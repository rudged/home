MARRIAGE -<cite>MARRIAGE - "Coble-Rudge. February 2nd 1897 will be a date ever memorable in the calendar of life to Mr. J. B. Coble and Miss Carrie Rudge, for on that date they vowed eternal constancy, fidelity and love one for the other and called upon God to witness that they were one and were pronounced man and wife by the minister. The marriage took place at the residence of the bride's father, Mr. J. W. Rudge at 10:30 o'clock. Only a few of the close friends of the bride and groom were present. The attendants were Mr. Frank Lowe with Miss Stella Bourne; Mr. Will Rudge with Miss Lizzie Andrews; Mr. Claude S. Jones, of Abbeville, S.C.; was best man and Miss Kate Rudge, sister of the bride, was bridesmaid. Rev. H. M. Dixon, pastor of the Presbyterian church performed the services. The groom is a native of Randolph county and is an engineer on the G.C. & N. road. he is a very popular man and has a host of friends in Monroe. The bride is a lady of most charming graces and noble Christian character. She is one of the most popular young ladies of Monroe and it is not a mere matter of form that we say that she is a woman worthy of the love of a husband who is so fortunate as to win her hand and heart. After the marriage Mr. and Mrs. Coble left for points in Georgia and Florida. They will be away about three weeks when they return and make Monroe their home. With their many other friends here we wish for Mr. and Mrs. Coble every joy that is ever vouchsafed to mortals and that their married life may reach as nearly to the perfection of happiness as it is possible."</cite>
<p>
After their marriage, Carrie Virginia nee RUDGE COBLE and her husband moved to Abbeville, SC where they lived from ca. 1904-1907. <cite>"Mr. J. B. Coble moved his family last week to Abbeville, S.C."</cite> (22 Dec 1903 The Monroe Journal p. 3) <cite>"Mr. and Mrs. J. B. Coble have returned to Monroe to live and are occupying their home on Washington Street."</cite> (30 Apr 1907 The Monroe Journal p. 3). 
<p>
DESCRIPTION OF THEIR HOUSE: <cite>"504 S. Washington Street - Bruner-Coble House; 1881 - C. W. Bruner, a grocery merchant, built this two-story frame Italianate house shortly after his 1881 purchase from J. R. Winchester of a lot on Washington Street. The Bruner's sold the house in 1893 to E. Q. Petteway, who sold it in 1905 to railroad engineer John B. Coble. The house remains in Coble family ownership today. A standing seam tin gable roof covers the two-story L-shaped main block, which has a three-bay facade and one-story wings extending across the rear. The two-bay front porch has chamfered posts with decoratively drilled bases, two sizes of brackets, a scroll-sawn frieze and turned balusters. Similar posts with sawn brackets support a one-story porch on the south elevation. The main entrance is topped by a transom; below the flanking sidelights are octagonal wood panels. Other decorative features include Italianate eaves brackets and arched louvered attic vents in the gable ends. Brick chimneys are in interior end and interior locations. Windows are six over six sash or paired four over four sash. The house sits back from the street surrounded by mature trees and shrubbery." </cite>(Sweet Union (1990) pp. 115-116.) The house eventually came into the hands of Bill and Carmel Cheek, who renovated it as a bed and breakfast.

OBITUARY: <cite>"MR. J. B. COBLE DIES SUDDENLY. Mr. J. B. Coble, a well known engineer on the Seaboard Air Line dropped dead in Stewart Street in rear of the Gloucester House last Monday afternoon about six o'clock. Mr. Coble, whose run is between Monroe and Abbeyville went out on his regular run Sunday,  but was taken sick at Abbeyville and came back as a passanger Monday afternoon. He was not very sick, apparently, and talked cheerfully and frequently with Captain B. H. Casen, who was in charge of the train. When he arrived here, Mr. Coble started to his home on Washington Street alone. He went by Mr. C. A. Tennant's home and made enquiry concerning the condition of Mr. Tennant, who is an engineer and is sick in a Charlotte hospital. He walked but a short distance from Mr. Tennant's home and was seen to stop and to fall. He was dead when assistance reached him. Heart trouble was the cause of his death and he had been suffering with it for some time and he realized that he could not live much longer. Mr. Coble was a native of Guilford county. He was born June 8, 1866, and was therefore nearly 64 years old. He came to Monroe as an employee of the Seaboard in 1892 and lived here from that time until his death. He married Miss Carrie Rudge, daughter of the late Mr. J. W. Rudge, February 2, 1897, and she and six sons and two daughters survive. The sons are Messrs. Emmett, Harry, John, Wesley, Paul, and David Coble and the daughters are Misses Caroline and Louise Coble. Mr. Coble was a splendid type of citizen. He was moral upright, industrious, and was a kind and helpful neighbor and a devoted husband and father. He was the soul of honor and was upright and just in all his dealings. He was a faithful member of the Presbyterian Church and was a sincere Christian. Funeral was held last Tuesday afternoon, services being conducted by Dr. H. E. Gurney. Fellow members of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers were the pall bearers."</cite>; 2ND OBITUARY: <cite>"J. B. COBLE WELL-KNOWN ENGINEER DROPPED DEAD. Was On His Way Home From Depot When His Heart Failed-Had Felt Slightly Ill That Morning. Mr. J. B. Coble, a popular and well-known Seaboard engineer, dropped dead on the street in the rear of the old Gloucester hotel late yesterday afternoon, as he was on his way home from the depot. He was walking alone at the time, apparently in usual health, when several persons in the vicinity saw him suddenly stop, gasp and fall to the ground. They rushed to his aid, but found him dead. Heart trouble caused his untimely end. Funeral services will be held this afternoon at the home of the deceased by his pastor, Dr. H. E. Gurney, Fellow-members of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers will act as pall bearers. The deceased drove his engine to Abbeville Sunday on his regular run, Monday morning he complained of feeling unwell, and decided not to attempt to drive his engine back to Monroe that evening. Instead he boarded the Atlanta train, which arrived here at 6 o'clock yesterday afternoon. Capt. B. H. Cason, who was in charge of this train, says Mr. Coble did not appear to be ill, as he talked and laughed with him a great part of the way between Abbeville and Monroe. After leaving the station, Mr. Coble stopped at the home of Mr. C. A. Tenant long enough to enquire after the health of Mr. Tenant, who is very ill in a Charlotte hospital. Born in Guilford county, June 8, 1866, Mr. Coble would have been 54 years old had he lived a few weeks longer. In 1892 he came to Monroe to accept a position with the Seaboard which he held up until his death. He was married to Miss Carrie Rudge, daughter of the late J. W. Rudge, on Feb. 2, 1897, and she with eight children survive him. They are Misses Caroline and Louise Coble, and Messrs Emmett, Harry, John, Wesley, Paul and David Coble. For years Mr. Coble had been a contientious member of the Presbyterian church. He was an industrious citizen, devoted to his family; a good neighbor, and a gentleman in the strictest sense of the word. His untimely death has caused his hundreds of friends much concern, and his passing was a shock to the people of Monroe."</cite> (20 Apr 1920 The Monroe Journal, p. 1)

RESOLUTION OF RESPECT: <em> "IN MEMORIAM. MRS. CARRIE RUDGE COBLE. In the home going of Mrs. Carrie Rudge Coble, on the morning of Sept. 29th, we, the Women of the First Presbyterian church have lost a good friend and faithful member. Though for many years she had been prevented by illness from taking an active part in the affairs of the church her concern never diminished. Firm in the Christian faith she accepted life with its joys and sorrows. Her patience and cheerfulness were outward evidences of the strength gained from the habit of reading the scriptures daily- a practice she maintained until shortly before her death. She reached for and found good in all people. Her life was a radiant example of Christian grace. Even during her illness of several years her interest in the church remained keen and she shared in its works, near and far through prayer and gifts. Her life was marked by her devotion to her church, her intimate knowledge of the Bible and her remarkable power of prayer. We express sympathy to the members of her family and admiration for their loyalty and comfort and love they gave her during her long illness. May it well be said of her, "Well done thou good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joys of the Kingdom. By Mrs. C. M. Redfern." </em> (Monroe Enquirer)

Kenneth also appears in a group photograph <a href="griffiths.html">here</a>.

Kenneth traveled widely and had many interests, including genealogy. Here's a copy of a letter he wrote me just a few years before he died:
<p>
<cite>"Your visit to England sounds most interesting, and particularly your findings in the West Country. The only reason I went there in a kind of vague search for family connections with the Reudge [sic] clan is that a cousin of my grandmother's from Richmond (not a Rudge but on the Pae side) had looked at some family papers in a vain effort to get Aunt Kate [Rudge Griffith] into the DAR. She didn't show them to me, but just wrote out the names and places to go. And that was all. I do recall, however, a letter from her that may still be in Monroe giving more information but finally adding that all the papers were with the Banks cousins in Savannah. That is, I'm sure, where they still are and if there is any written evidence of any ties with the Gloucester-Evesham setting that you visited it may be that the papers in Savannah will have it. All I know is what I have told you before and this further possibility. Unfortunately no one in Monroe except my grandmother could rmember [sic] anything or had any papers. Most of what I heard was simply oral history, stories handed down and probably confused. The few pictures and papers we do have will be sent in your direction fairly soon. Among these stories, that I haerd [sic] when I was in high school, was that our Rudges had left the West of England toward the end of the eighteenth century and lived for a time near London. One of them went to India and was connected with the East India Company. As you already know our great grandfather (your great great) John William Rudge was born in Le Havre, (France) while his father was engaged as an engineer in the rebuilding of the port. I have a daguerrotype of him and his older brother Thomas taken there, probably in about 1852-1855. I also recall that when they entered this country they came to Philadelphia first, then Savannah. There may be records of entry there in the immigration office. Mamma Carrie (my grandmother) and Aunt Kate always kept little bits of French phrases that they used to hear as children from this episode."</cite> (Letter written by Kenneth Rudge Wilson Jones to Dave Rudge 20 Mar 1983)

OBITUARY: <cite>"Kenneth R. W. Jones: 1930-1986. DR. KENNETH RUDGE WILSON JONES, 56, Professor of French and chairman of that department at the University of the South, died on June 28 at Sewanee. An especially popular instructor, his funeral attracted a large number of students and alumni, many of whom travelled long distances to pay tribute to a man whose wit and teaching ability made him a favorite at Sewanee for over twenty years. A native of Monroe, North Carolina, Dr. Jones graduated from Davidson College, and then received his master's and doctorate from the University of North Carolina. He also studied as a Fulbright Scholar at the University of Dijon, France. Before coming to Sewanee, he was a member of the faculty at Louisiana State University. In addition to his teaching duties, he was secretary of the Sewanee chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, a member of the Red Ribbon Society and the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. He was also a member of the 8:00 congregation at All Saint's Chapel. Traditionally, the ideal Sewanee professor is someone who interacts well with students both in the classroom and elsewhere. In many ways, Dr. Jones epitomized that ideal. He knew a great many students, and enjoyed inviting them for meals and conversations at his home. In class, he was demanding and thorough. In the words of one former student, "I would get up at 6:00 to work for that class. I was miserable if I wasn't prepared." The funeral was conducted by the Reverend Herbert S. Wentz, Professor of Religion in the College and Marshall of the University Faculties. Dr. Jones was buried in the University Cemetery. Dr. Jones' life and work, and the many friendships he cultivated here, ensure that his memory will live on among all those who knew him. As professor and friend, Dr. Kenneth Jones has joined the ranks of that select group of Sewanee professors who are remembered with affection and respect for decades to come."</cite> 2nd OBITUARY: <cite>"Kenneth W. Jones. Kenneth Wilson Jones, 56, of Sewanee, Tenn., a Monroe native, died June 28 in Emerald Hodgeson Hospital in Sewanee, after a short illness.
