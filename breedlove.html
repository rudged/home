<em>"I am working on papers for the D.A.R. on my mother’s side, but it takes time. I have gone back to the fourth generation. Your great, great, great grandmother Lucy Williamson was first cousin to James Madison who was the first Bishop of Virginia and he was brother to Pres. Madison or cousin, I’m not sure. "</em> (letter from Lelia nee Houston Brett to Frances nee Kenney King 21 Jan 1957)
<p>
Breedlove is a very commmon name. Most of the information below has been taken from the following <a href="http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/b/r/e/Joni-L-Breedlove/GENE11-0001.html">site</a> created by Joni Lyn Harris Breedlove. Please direct more general questions about the Breedlove family to her. My research is focused on just two questions: (1) identifying the parents of my ancestor, Mary Oglevy nee Breedlove Williamson, and (2) identifying whether there is a connection between the Breedlove and Madison families.

<p>
<a name="eleven"><strong>11. William<sup>3</sup> BREEDLOVE</strong> (<a href="#three">Alleman</a><sup>2</sup>, <a href="#one">Charles</a><sup>1</sup>). He was born ca. 1743 in Virginia. He died before 24 Jan 1803 in St. David's Parish, King William Co., VA. 
<p>
William married <strong>- MADISON</strong> ca. 1770 in Virginia. She was alive at the time of the writing of her husband's will on 21 Sep 1801.
<p>
CONNECTION TO THE MADISON FAMILY: I conjecture that William's wife's maiden name was Madison on the basis of the note written by Louisa Rudge Coble Bareford (top of this page), many of the details of which have proven to be accurate as documented by several records, the transcripts of which are found on this site. The fact William named his only son "Madison" is also suggestive, as representing a maiden name on his wife's side. President James Madison's family lived in King and Queen Co. VA and King William Co. VA. Our best clue yet is a lawsuit (transcribed below) that refers to members of both the Madison and Breedlove families. Unfortunately neither the connection to our Breedlove family nor President James's Madison's family is obvious. 
<p>
LAWSUIT: <em>"July Court MDCCXCV [1795]. Whereas in a suit in Chancery lately depending in the County Court of King William there was a Decree made in the cause in . . . at a Court cont'd & held for King Wm. County the 30th day of May 1792.
