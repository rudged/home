<p>
<a name="one"><strong>1. James<sup>1</sup> YOUNG</strong>. He was born ca. 1785 in the Parish Of Jedburgh, Scotland. According to what appears to be his tombstone and a probate notice, he died on 4 Dec 1859 at his residence in Lake Mills and is buried at the Lake Ripley Cemetery, Cambridge, Jefferson Co. WI. He immigrated to the United States from Scotland and was a farmer. According to family tradition and his son John's obituary, he and his family migrated ca. 1828 first to Madrid, St. Lawrence Co. NY and then subsequently migrated west by way of Waukesha and Rutherford to Lake Mills, Jefferson Co. WI. James and his wife are included in the 1850 census for Lake Mills, Jefferson Co. WI.
<p>
James married <strong>Isabella [Isabel, Isabelle] AINSLIE</strong> on 31 May 1812 in Morebattle, Roxborough, Scotland. Isabella was born ca. 1797 in Scotland according to an 1850 census entry for Lake Mills, Jefferson Co. WI. (She may be one and the same "Isable Ainslie" who was born 6 Oct 1797 in Gorbals, Lanark, Scotland to William and Isabele nee Pegan Ainslie.) She died of paralysis on 16 Dec 1879 in Jefferson, Jefferson Co. WI (Record of Death, Pre-1907 Wisconsin Death Record, Co. Jefferson, v. 1, page 110). [According to her record of death she was 88 years old at the time of her death, which means she might have been born ca. 1791]. She was a housewife.

<p>
"Isabell" is identified as a head of household in the 1860 census for Lake Mills, Jefferson Co. WI. Most of what we know about her comes from probate records associated with the disposition of her estate. These records strongly suggest she had been living on her own since 1860. Her son John was made her legal guardian, and after her death there was apparently some confusion about whether she would have wanted her house in Lake Mills to be sold.
<p>
A "Mary" Young (age 74) who appears in the 1870 census for Lake Mills, Jefferson Co. WI. She is listed as living with her son Robert. Both are listed as having been born in New York.

Mother moved because she did not consider it that she could keep a house, her means were exhausted. The house then stood vacant about 5 months, then we rented it out. We calculated that the removal was not temporary. It was her intention as we understand was not to return. I furnished her all the provisions she was provided for by me, also rented her the house. She owned no other real estate. She had no other personal goods not anything else that came to my hands for her. Mother bought out lot 42 above 1859 - 1860 above 20 years. There is a dwelling house on the premises. I think there is an acre and 1/8-Lake Mills. She occupied it to above 1874, some 18 years occupied it as a homestead. In 1873 or 1874 she removed to Jefferson, might be later, before her removal she occupied it as her homestead. No one but herself was in the family but Robert, after  she came to Jefferson she acquired no other homestead. I heard her say that she was not going back there to live, heard her say so at the house she lived in Jefferson don't know that anyone was present except this Robert. I t was along in June or July 1879. She said I could sell the place for her she would never go back there. The first or two years after she came to Jefferson she got dissatisfied and wanted to go back to Lake Mills. But not afterward, I received the care of her property and paid the care here. Redirect. She never occupied the house in Lake Mills any more after she came to Jefferson. We had some conversation about selling the property with my sister and mother.

<cite>"Some Snakes. This seems to be about the time of year for snake stories, therefore, John Young related the following to us and vouches for its accuracy: While he was cutting hay on his marsh, he heard the hissing of a snake, and soon discovered a large massanger, which he killed and found it to measure thirty-three and one-third inches in length, and about nine inches around. It was cut open and found to contain four young snakes-varying in size from five to seven inches in length, and the strangest part of this thing is (now mind this is what Mr. Young positively states), they all had rattles, one of them having five. Now in view of this fact what becomes of the theory that the rattles upon the snakes grow one each year. It is a problem we shall leave to others to solve."</cite> (Lake Mills Spike 14 Sep 1880)

THIRTIETH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY-<cite>"On the 10th of December 1851, John Young and his wife started together on their matrimonial life and during the thirty years past have 'lived wisely and well.' Saturday last being the thirtieth anniversary of the wedding day a number of the friends concluded to give the worthy couple a surprise party and to celebrate the linen wedding. With this object in view a goodly number of friends gathered at the hospitable home of John Young and took possession; soon the object of the visit was made known and a right royal time ensued. Ample refreshments were served by Mrs. Young, after doing full justice to the tempting viands, Mr. and Mrs. Young were presented with some very handsome articles of linen as souvenirs of the occasion. The pleasant gathering soon after dispersed with the hopes that the couple might be spared to celebrate their Golden Wedding."</cite> (Lake Mills Spike 15 Dec 1881)

OBITUARY- <cite>"Obituary. One by one the old residents are dropping out of the circle of friends and neighbors, and before many years all those whose labors here date back to the fifties will have passed beyond. Mr. John Young, who died last week, was born in Scotland in the year 1824. When he was but a child of four years, his parents emigrated to America and settled in Madrid, in the state of New York. When he reached the age of twenty-one he seems to have started out for himself and came to Waukesha in this state, at which place he remained for five years. He then came to the vicinity of Lake Mills where he has lived during the remaining time. In 1850 Mr. Young bought a farm southwest of the village in the Rutherford neighborhood. He lived upon this farm for a few years, and then bought the farm west of the lake which was the home of the family for so many years. About five years ago Mr. Young bought the house in the village where he lived at the time of his last sickness. Mr. Young was married in the year of 1851 to Jenette Neff. To them were born nine children, of whom but four lived to mature years. After a painful sickness of eight days duration, Mr. Young died on Wednesday, January 27th. The funeral was held on Friday, January 27th at the home of the family, Rev. S. M. MacNeill conducting the service. Mrs. Young and the four daughters have the sympathy of a large circle of friends in their bereavement. Mr. Young was a kind, loving husband and father, a good neighbor and a good citizen, and his cheery greetings will be missed by all who knew him, as the days make real the fact that he has gone from among us."</cite>  (Lake Mills Leader 4 Feb 1897, p. 3) [The newspaper also has an advertisement for Rev. S. M. MacNeill as the pastor of the Congregational Church.] 2nd OBITUARY- <cite>"Last Wednesday noon, Mr. John Young, one of the oldest residents of this vicinity, was called to his eternal home. Mr. Young, was born in Northumberlandshire, Scotland in 1824. His parents removed to this country and settled in Madrid, N.Y. when he was four years old.

Last February Mrs. Breitkreutz was seized with a severe attack of the grippe, other complications developed which brought her to the brink of the grave. To the surprise of many she improved, for a time, but the disease made such inroads upon her health and general appearance that she appeared like a very aged person. Her health continued more or less precarious, sometimes being pretty good and again considerably worse. Last week, however, she felt exceptionally well, when suddenly last Friday morning she had a violent attack of coughing, followed by convulsions. Still, the worst was not expected. At midnight, however, the unseen messenger came and delivered her from all mortal ailments.
