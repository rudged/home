University</u><br>Michigan State University (MSU) plans to continue to provide national leadership in science education scholarship in the coming decades and seeks candidates of exceptional scholarly and professional accomplishments or promise to fill a two-year Research Associate position beginning in August 2006 or as soon thereafter as possible. This opportunity will allow the selected associate to engage in research in the professional development of science teachers, centered on problems of practice through PBL TPC (Problem Based Learning and Teachers' Professional Continuum http://www.msu.edu/~pbltpc/). This research associate will participate in these new projects in collaboration with faculty, graduate students, professional staff, and practicing teachers. In addition, the research associate will have the opportunity to develop significant expertise in materials development, including theories of teaching and learning applied to science education and educational research methods. This project is located jointly in the Teacher Education Department of the College of Education which has been ranked the No. 1 program of its kind in the nation for the past ten years, and in the Division of Science and Mathematics Education in the College of Natural Science. The NSF-funded project centered on teachers' problems of practice, involves faculty from several departments at Michigan State University. Candidates should have a strong commitment to education, a strong background in science and have completed a doctoral degree in science education prior to beginning their work as a research associate. Candidates should also have strong analytical and organizational abilities, strong written and oral communication skills, and the ability to work well and assume leadership responsibilities in a team environment. Additional desirable qualifications include prior teaching experience in science at the middle- or high-school levels, a deep understanding of science, experience working with teachers, administrators, and university faculty, and knowledge or interest in case-based pedagogy or technology. The term can start as early as August 16, 2006. Women and minorities are strongly encouraged to apply and the salary will be competitive. If the research assistant is interested, opportunities to teach in the teacher-education program may be arranged. A complete application package consists of a cover letter describing your background relevant to this position and your reasons for wanting to join the project, a curriculum vita, a copy of transcripts and three letters of reference.
