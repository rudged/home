Here's a genealogy for one branch of the Pae family that migrated from Scotland to Richmond, VA and ultimately Wilmington, NC. The definitive source on the Pae family is Kyle, Phyllis Richards (1986) <em>Pae dirt : diggings into some old records and recent recollections of Pae families in England, Scotland Canada, and the United States</em> /  Rev. and enl.  Lakewood, Ohio] : P.R.  Kyle, 1986]  iv, 115 leaves, 11] leaves of plates ; 29 cm. Ours is the Southern Pae family Kyle mentions never got around to researching. I no longer have a copy.
<p>
Madge Pae has done some additional research on the Pae family, primarily devoted to the descendants of <a href="#eleven">11. George Pae</a>. You are welcome to contact her at the following email address: madgepae@fireflyuk.net.
<p>
My own research on <a href="#eighteen">18. Alexander Pae</a> and his descendants suggests that the southern branch of the Pae family traces back to a branch upon which Kyle has done extensive research among the parish records of Coldingham, Berwickshire, Scotland. I include the outline she provides of the ancestry of this branch below - all of it is based on her work and some additional records I have obtained from the LDS family history library in Salt Lake City.

Alexander married <strong>Isobel MUIR/MOORE</strong> on 23 Mar 1787 in Coldingham, Berwick, Scotland. Alexander was a joiner (carpenter).
<p>
MARRIAGE RECORD: <em>"[Coldingham, Berwickshire, Scotland Parish Records] 23 March 1787. Alexr. Pae & Isabel Moore both in this parish were irregularly married at Haddington, according to the form of matrimony prescribed & used by the Church of England by Signed J. Burkmann Minst. The above marriage was regulained by the Session, Sunday 8th July 1787."</em> (LDS record Batch M117325 Input 1067869; Kyle's PAE DIRT curiously does not include this record.)
<p>
Kyle notes "There is no birth or marriage record in Coldingham or the neighboring  parishes but George<sup>4</sup> is identified as Alexander's father in the baptismal records of his children, and his wife is given as Isabel Muir in all of them. In the record of the seventh child, born in 1808, Alexander was called 'jr.' although one witness was 'George Pae his father.' There were two older Alexanders who might still have been living; one aged 68 who would have been his father's half brother; and on 59, probably more distantly related." Kyle goes on to list their first seven children. [Pae Dirt by Phyllis Richards Kyle (1986) p. 24]. 
<p>
As noted above at the start of this entry, Madge Pae has located a record of baptism for Alexander Pae, son of George Pea and Barbara Hewitt among the baptismal records associated with Lamberton, Scotland.
<p>
FURTHER RESEARCH: As noted above, I was able to locate a marriage record for Alexander PAE and Isobel Moore from the LDS. I suspect the title "jr." Kyle worries about was a reference to Alexander's occupation as a joiner, but it was indeed common for individuals with the same first name during this time period to be distinguished as jr. and sr. without it implying they were father and son. I have also located a christening record for an additional son, Archibald PAE, who represents an eighth child by this marriage. The baptism is mentioned among a set of parish records Kyle did <u>not</u> search [Falkirk, Stirling Scotland] and clearly states the names of the parents as Alexander PAE and Isabel MUIR in common with the other baptismal records. [Madge Pae has discovered the baptismal record of a ninth child to this marriage noted below, named Isabel.]
<p>
I am inclined to think that this eighth son, Archibald PAE, is one and the same as my ancestor. According to family tradition he came from Stirling, Scotland. In the census records and obituary I have located for him, he is listed as about the same age. The key points of similarity, however, have to do with a close relative named James who also migrated with him to Richmond, Henrico Co. VA. I believe he is one and the same as James Valence PAE - they are the same age, each married a woman named Catherine, and the James PAE who migrated to VA had a daughter named Isabella. It would be particularly helpful to find out whether there is any record of either James Valence his brother Archibald in Scotland after 1835. On my theory, there should not be. Locating their father, Alexander PAE,'s will is another way in which this connection could be established.
<p>
FAMILY TRADITION: <em>"Archibald was from Sherlivg, Scotland" Also " youngest brother. _James_ oldest a sister Catherine, James built locomotives in Richmond (Sampson & Pae). Foundry leveled by Yankees in Civil War."</em> (note discovered by Frances Kenney King, one of Archibald's descendants (1/7/94).

James Valence PAE married <strong>Catherine ALLAN</strong> on 11 Jun 1819 in Falkirk, Stirling, Scotland. (LDS Batch M119705, Input source 1041944, 0102111).
There is a duplicate, possibly a record of intention to marry registered at Larbert, Stirling, Scotland on 6 Jun 1819 (M114852, 1041953 0102122). According to U.S. census records she was born ca. 1796 in Scotland. She died on 19 Feb 1873 in Petersburg, VA, and was buried on 16 Jun 1873 in the Hollywood Cemetery, Richmond, VA.
<p>
RECORD OF INTENTION OF MARRIAGE:<em> "6 Jun [1819] James Pae of this parish and Catherine Allan of the parish of Falkirk were regularly proclaimed in order to marriage and no objections offered."</em> [Parish records of Larbert, Stirlingshire, Scotland]
<p>
RECORD OF MARRIAGE: <em>"30 May [1819] James Pae of the Parish of Lambert and Catherine Allan of this parish. Married 11 June [1819]"</em> [Parish records of Falkirk, Stirling, Scotland]
<p>
"James Pae" (age 42), his wife "Cath. " (age 35), and two children, "Alexand."  (age 9) and "Isabl. " (age 6 months) arrived on 14 Mar 1836 aboard the S.S. Groton, which left from Liverpool, England. At least two of James' brothers (Archibald and William) also migrated to the US about this time.
<p>
1840 CENSUS: <em>James Pae - one man aged 30-40 (James ?), with a boy aged 10-15 (son Alexander), one woman aged 40-50 (wife Catherine) and a girl aged under 5 (daughter Isabella); and 5 male and 2 female slaves, a total of "17"? of which 12 are said to be engaged in manufacturing.</em> (Pae, Jaems Hn C 443 Richmond) Despite the slight discrepancy in age, his proximity to Archibald, the fact he is apparently married and is engaged in manufacturing strongly suggest this is James Valence PAE. I note further that the one person between Archibald and James is Annabelle Burr, whose last name is identical to that of the older partner who later drops out of the Richmond Foundry.
<p>
1850 CENSUS: <em> James Pae - age 56, wife Catherine age 53, daughter Isabella Pae age 15, brother of husband William Pae age 42. Isabella born in VA, others born in Scotland. Thomas Sampson, age 55, a manufacturer born in Scotland is also listed as residing in this household.</em> (Pae, James Hn C 437 Richmond). [Note there is a second James Pae in this census living close by aged 45, from Scotland and a finisher. (Pae, Jaems Hn C 443 Richmond)].
<p>
1860 CENSUS: <em>In the 1860 census, James Pea (66) is included with wife Catherine (64). He is listed as an iron merchant, from Scotland.</em> (Pae, James 966 Richmond W. Div).
<p>
There is a confederate application for a presidential pardon by James Pae that was written in 5 Jul 1865, about a month before his death that mentions his factory being burnt down during the war and proclaims his allegiance to the United States [Confederate Applications for Presidential Pardons 1865-1867].

<p>
He may be the John Pae who married Ann Kidston on 11 Jun 1819 in Falkirk, Sterling Scotland (Batch M119706, Input source 1041945). A copy of the actual record, however, indiates the marriage took place on 21 Jan 1825. In this record, John is identified as being of the parish of Larbert. (There is a duplicate, possibly a record of intention to marry registered at Larbert, Stirling, Scotland on 6 Jun 1819 (M114854, 1041953 0102122). A copy of this latter record indicates the marriage took place on 16 Jan 1825.) However I note that another John Pea married a Betty Brown on 25 Aug 1801 in Falkirk, Sterling, Scotland (Batch M119705, 1041945) - in which case the former marriage might be this John Pae's second wife.

Kyle asks "Was this William the dyer who married Mary Wilson and had sons James, Robert born 1835, William, 1839 and John 1843?" (Phyllis Richards Kyle (1986) Pae Dirt p. 25). I suggest he was not, and instead contend he migrated with his brothers to the United States.
<p>
Madge Pae has located a record of marriage that appears to pertain to this William Pae. Among the marriage records for the parish of Larbert, Stirlingshire, Scotland, is one between William PHAE and <strong>Eliza MARCILLE</strong>, both of Rouen, France. They were married on 20 Jan 1833 in Larbert, Stirlingshire, Scotland. (Marriage records of Larbert, Stirlingshire, Scotland 1833 485/2). This is the same Scottish parish in which his older brothers George and James Valence were married (above).
<p>
CITY DIRECTORY: <em>"Pae, William, pudler at Armory Iron Works" (1856 Richmond City Directory, p. 191); "Pae, William, barkeeper, James McConnel, bds. same" (1860 Richmond City Directory, p. 174)</em>
<p>
He is probably the William Pae who is listed as a brother of James Valence PAE in the 1850 census entry for his brother above- the age agrees.
<p>
He may be the William Pae who fought on the side of the Confederacy for Virginia. There is a military record of a William Pae serving in an infantry unit.

I have located several records detailing land transactions he was engaged in between 24 Apr 1852 and 1855 among Chestefield and Henrico Co. records. He is referred to as a machinist in the 1860 city directory for Richmond, Henrico Co. VA (Ferslew, W. E.

<p>
RECOLLECTIONS OF HIM: <em>"When Zerah Colburn, a noted engineer and writer upon the mechanism of railways visited the establishment [Uriah Well's Locomotive and Car Works, Petersburg, VA] in 1857, he noted that there was room for 500 people to work in the two shops, though a thorough overhauling of the style of work was necessary. He spoke of six engines as having been built in the previous several years, for the South Side Rail Road, and said that one hundred and twenty five freight and baggage cars had been built in one year. The foreman had been Archibald Pae, later Master Mechanic of the Virginia Central Rail Road. . .

SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT: <em>"OFFICE VA. CENTRAL R.R. Co., Richmond, Oct. 1st, 1856. To the President and Directors of the Virginia Central Railroad Company. Gentlemen: I herewith submit a statement of the operations of the road for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1856... Locomotives... The most serious cause of accident, or likely to produce it upon your road, is the frequent obstruction of the track by cattle. Constant fears are entertained for the safety of the trains on that account. Fortunately no serious accident has occurred endangering materially the property of the Company. It is true by the work of an incendiary last winter on the west side of the Blue Ridge, the Company sustained a loss of having two of the most valuable locomotives (the Baldwin and Mason mountain climbers) burnt, so as to make it necessary to rebuild them pretty much, except the boilers. While it was a loss, yet the Company was fortunate in having in its employment one of the most skillful and best qualified master machinists, Mr. Archer [sic] Pae, who understands the work of building locomotives, and from his superior skill in a few weeks had them anew, equal if not better than they were when they first came out of the builders' hands, and on the mountain again crossing the Blue Ridge, taking the crowds of passengers and freight that thronged your road the past summer."</em> (Eighteenth Annual Report by the Virginia Central Railroad Company 10 Nov 1853, which includes entries dated later, p. 23-28).
<p>
According to family tradition, during the American Civil War Archibald was a war contractor in the employ of Sampson & Pae. Sampson & Pae was a Richmond machine shop which finished weapons cast by William James Hubard. The shop was started by Archibald's brother, James Valence Pae (an iron merchant), and Thomas Sampson. The foundry was destroyed by Union troops during the Civil War.

Mr. Archer [sic] Pae, for many years superintendant of the Central Railroad shop, but now in the employ of Flippen & Hightower, Pittsylvania county, has just completed and forwarded to the Tredegar Works two slide lathes, for turning and cutting screws, which, for substantial usefulness, equal any ever purchased at the North. Mr. Pae is a superior mechanic, and, having had large experience in all branches of his trade, can get up cotton factory and other machinery with as much facility as any other workman in the South.

At the close of the war, Archibald and his family migrated to Wilmington, NC. He is listed as a machinist with the W and WRR in the Wilmington Directory for 1871 (T. M. Haddocck's 1871 Wilmington City Directory, Wilmington, NC pp. 182, 240.

FIRST OBITUARY: <em>"Died, at the residence of his father, on Saturday the 25th inst., at midnight, in his 21st year, Mr. ALEXANDER PAE, of an attack of bilous fever, of a few days continuance."</em> (1 Oct 1847 Enquirer (Richmond, VA), page 4; 1 Oct 1847 Richmond Whig (Richmond, VA p. 4); SECOND OBITUARY: <em> "DIED, after a short sickness, on Saturday, 25th September, ALEXANDER PAE, in the 21st year of his age. As the husbandman plants the shoot and trains its stem, waters its soil, trims its boughs, and protects its growth, until year by year it puts forth a graceful foliage and becomes the beauty of the grove; so the hand of the Almighty dealt with him whose once ruddy cheek and manly form now lies in a narrow grave. Old age naturally expires in its twilight-the brightness of manhood like the sun in his zenith may be obscured by a cloud; but alas! here in the morning of life, blooming with the tints of youth and beaming with the rays of hope, overshadowed by the wing of death. "How unsearchable are the judgments of the Almighty and his ways past finding out!" When one so young and in robust health suddenly sickens and dies, how vain seem the fairest prospects of life- how truly does our existence appear like the flower on the field-"the wind passeth over it and it is gone!" "Time is fleeting, And our hearts, though stout and brave, Still, like muffled drums, are beating, Funeral marches to the grave!" The last solemn march of our youthful friend is finished, and his heart has ceased to beat: But when he was with us, his amiable disposition gained a warm place in the bosom of his friends; and his quiet, unobtrusive spirit, beautifully contrasting with the rude temper of the mass, attracted all his acquaintance. So upright and dutiful a son was he that he became a counsellor and companion of his parents- a fit solace for their declining years, and a proper staff for their increasing age. No earthly gains can compensate their loss- no human means can repair the desolation of their hearts; but in their affliction they have the consolation that death has come without his sting, and the grave has gained no victory. In an hour when Hope spread out long years to come, and health flattered with a pleasant prospect, their son resigned the pleasure of this world and sought favour with his Creator. In his short career, he adorned the doctrine of the Saviour with a godly life; and when the "King of Terrors" came, as his own words testified, he was ready! Gently he trod the path of life-calmly he passed through the vale of death- and peacefully his spirt rests within the gates of Heaven! "And when ye stand Where that fair brow and those unfrosted locks Return to dust-where the young sleeper waits The resurrection morn, -oh! lift the heart In praise to him who gave the victory!" A. COMPANION."</em> (8 Oct 1847 Richmond Whig (Richmond, VA) p. 4)

He was born on 22 Dec 1836 in Richmond, Henrico Co. VA. According to his certificate of death, he died owing to severe dementia and bronchial pneumonia on 25 Dec 1926 at the Eastern State Hospital in Williamsburg, VA. He was buried in Scottsburg, Halifax Co. VA on 27 Dec 1926. He was an engineer.
<p>
According to an article written about his uncle, Samuel S. Bath, James claimed to have migrated West with his uncle ca. 1850. He stayed with his uncle for a short time and returned back to Virginia, residing for a time in Newport News. He ultimately wound up in Scottsburg, VA and was still living there in 1922 according to his younger sister Catherine's obituary (below). According to an annotated photograph of <a href="jap.html">James A. Pae</a>, he died in 1930. This photograph identifies him as an "Engineer And Mach. On Donirick R." In a newspaper account (below) he indicates he served in the Sixth Virginia Regiment during the civil war.
<p>
James A. PAE married <strong>Susan R. TUCK</strong>, daughter of Madison Allen and Sarah (Sallie) nee Dunkley Tuck, on 13 Dec 1860 in Halifax Co. VA. She was born ca. July 1842 in Halifax Co. Virginia. She died sometime between 1920 when she appears in the census for Roanoke, Halifax Co. VA and 25 Dec 1926, when, according to her husband's record of death he is listed as widowed.
<p>
CENSUS ENTRIES: James is included in the VA 1840-1860 census entries for his father. Susan "Pac" is included in the 1880 census entry for her parents, but curiously her husband does not appear. In the 1900 census for Roanoke, Halifax Co. VA, supervisor district no. 6, enumeration district no. 55, sheet 4, line 10, there appears the following entry: "Pae, James A.; Head; W; M; Dec 1837; 63; M; 39; born in VA; father born in Scotland, mother born in VA; locomotive engineer, not employed during the last 7 months; rents home. With him are his wife, Susan, and a brother-in-law, George W. Tuck. James and his wife also appear in the 1920 census for Roanoke, Halifax Co. VA.
<p>
An article containing reminiscences by Dr. J. M. Blair, one of the first residents of the Monroe mentions the following story.<em>"The railway came in 1873. It was a great occasion, and hundreds of people came to Monroe for miles around to see the trains run. I rode on the first that went out of Monroe. It was only a work train, just a couple of cars hooked on to a dinkly little engine. But we thought it was a wonderful thing back in those days. James Pea, a brother of Mrs. John Rudge, was the engineer, and he let his nephew, Eugene Moore, and myself, ride in the engine with him to Wingate, which was then known as 'Ames' Turnout.' It was named after Col. Ames, who was one of the construction engineers. We walked back from 'Ames' Turnout'."</em> (19 Jan 1917 The Monroe Journal p. 1)
<p>
NEWSPAPER ARTICLE ABOUT HIM: <em>"A VALUABLE INVENTION.-We clip from an Alabama paper, the following in regard to an invention recently made by Capt. James Pae, once a well-known engineer on the Carolina Central Railway. Mr. James A. Pae, one of the engineers on the M.& E. R. R. has invented a new contrivance, which promises to be of very great benefit to the traveling public. It is a device for arresting or preventing the escape of sparks from the smoke stacks of coal or wood  burning locomotives, steamboats and also can be used on stationary engines. All those who travel on railroads, particularly those roads on which they burn coal, are aware how disagreeable are the sparks coming from the locomotive, filling the eyes, ears and very frequently burning holes in clothing. By Mr. Pae's invention all this is prevented and not one single spark is permitted to escape, to annoy the passengers, and not only is this prevented, but the escaped sparks are utilized by this new improvement; they are collected in a box and by means of small pipes can be used to sand the track or else for the ballast, the machinery of the engine is also protected from the wear usually caused by falling sparks. Mr. Pae has applied for a patent of this new discovery, which promises to be a blessing to the travelling public. Another benefit derived from it, is, its economy, it costs less to construct one and fuel is saved by its use. Mr. Pae desires us to say to those railroads who contemplate using a spark arrester or another patent to hold on and give his a fair trial. His has been carefully examined by many railroad officials and pronounced excellent."</em> (25 Jun 1877 Monroe Enquirer p. 3)
<p>
NEWSPAPER ARTICLE ABOUT HIM: <em>"WANTS TO BE A COURIER. There is an old Confederate "Vet" in Newport News who is anxious to be one of Lee's couriers. James A. Pae is the old soldier's name. He saw service in the Sixth Virginia Regiment during the civil war and says he is ready to go to Cuba as a courier if General Lee will make a place for --m.

I believe she is the white female aged five or less in the entry for her father in the 1840 census for Richmond. A "Catherine Pae" age 11 is in the 1850 Lower Economic District, Chesterfield Co. VA census for her father. 
<p>
Catherine S. first married <strong>Alexander Hamilton Marks</strong>, son of William B. and Sarah L. Marks on 22 Jan 1856 in Richmond, Henrico Co. VA.

The next record strongly suggests Alexander and his wife must have divorced, as Catherine was remarried by 1880.

FIRST OBITUARY - <em>"MRS. CARRIE VIRGINIA RUDGE DIES SUDDENLY.  One of Monroe's Best Women Passed Away at Midnight Hour Tuesday Night. Mrs. Carrie Virginia Rudge died Tuesday night at 12:30 o'clock at the home of her daughter, Mrs. James T. Griffith on West Windsor street, following an acute attack of heart disease of about half-hour duration. Mrs. Rudge was a native of Richmond, Va. She was born in that city on March 4th, 1844, and was therefore a little more than 78 years of age. Before marriage she was Miss Carrie Virginia Paye. Her ancestors were of Scotch-English descent, but for several generations they had been Virginians. One brother, Mr. James A. Paye of Scottsburg, Va., survives.  Mrs. Rudge moved with her husband, the late J. W. Rudge, to Monroe from Wilmington 47 years ago, and Mr. Rudge died in 1915. One son, Mr. W. J. Rudge, and two daughters, Mrs. Carrie Coble and Mrs. James T. Griffith, all of Monroe, survive. For a number of years Mrs. Rudge had made her home with Mrs. Griffith and received all the kind consideration possible for children to bestow upon a beloved mother.

NOTICES OF DEATH AND OBITUARY: <CITE>"Last Saturday about 6:15 p.m., the incoming train of the M. & E. R. R. Met with quite an accident at the switch near Thompson's station. The switch had been turned from its regular position, so as to throw the train off the track. The train was going rather fast. The engine went off and turned over. The tender fell across the track. The cars all ran together, breaking off the platforms, but none of them left the rails. Mr. Zach. Pea [sic], the engineer, was badly scalded from his neck to his feet. He was caught in the fall of the engine near the safety valve, which opened and the hot steam came pouring on him. In this position he remained until the train help could reach him and get him away. He was carried to a house near by and about 8 o'clock Sunday morning was taken by a freight train, which left here Saturday night, and brought to the city, reaching his home Sunday morning. His injuries were very severe and his suffering intense until about half-past 3 o'clock Sunday afternoon, when he died. He was a superior engineer, and had been in the service of the road sometime. He was a kind, warm-hearted man and universally liked, and his death is a cause of sorrow to all who knew him.

<p>
OBITUARY:<em> "Dr. William Staton Anderson was born at or near Lizards Lick, in Marks Creek Township, Wake County, in a small community between Wendell & Zebulon, NC. He was the 3rd of 5 known surviving children (4 boys/1 girl) born to Jesse Staton Anderson and his (1st) wife Mary Todd. He was the paternal grandson of Henry Anderson (ca. 1763) and Lovey Staton; and gr-grandson of William Anderson (ca. 1715-1789) and his (2nd) wife Mourning Price, all of Edgecombe County. This branch of the Anderson's is believed to have migrated from Virginia to Bertie/Edgecombe County in the early 1700's. His father, Jesse Staton Anderson, removed from Edgecombe early 1840's, and most of his progeny stayed in the vicinity. On his mother's side, he was the maternal grandson of Moses Todd, Jr. & Elizabeth "Betsy" Massey of Wake County. William was just 8 years old when his mother died in 1853, and within a few years his 45-yr old father married (2nd) Mary Ann Tucker, the 25-year old daughter of McClendon Tucker & Martha Todd (his 1st wife's sister) of Wake County. This marriage resulted in the birth of 4 more children (2 boys/2 girls). When Mary Ann died in 1877, his father married her younger sister, Margaret Tucker, who was mother to his last child, Mary (ca. 1879). When Civil War broke out, William and his older brother Henry Harrison Anderson (age 18) enlisted with the Company H of the NC 31st Regiment. Older brother, James Lawrence Anderson (at age 21) would join the unit the following year. William was only 16 years old when he signed up with the NC 31st on October 14, 1861. His unit was stationed at Roanoke Island and engaged the invading Union army led by Brig. Gen. Ambrose Burnside on February 7-8, 1862. Battle of Roanoke Island became the one of the first major Union victories of the war, giving the Yankees control of the mouth of Albemarle Sound, a key Confederate bay that allowed the Union to threaten the Rebel capital of Richmond from the south. The 31st at Roanoke were reportedly "ill-equipped and poorly clothed, often armed with nothing more than their own shotguns. All told, the number came to about 1,400 infantrymen, but the number available for duty was smaller than that because the living conditions put as many as one-fourth of the command on the sick list." William was one of the 2,500 Confederates captured after the battle and held as POW. Private William S. Anderson was later part of the prisoner exchange and was discharged on March 1, 1863 at age 18. Both his older brothers remained with the NC 31st and both were wounded at the Battle of White Hall fought near Goldsboro, Wayne Co, on December 15-16, 1862. Regaining his health, the young man turned his eye towards healing, and pursued his education with vigor, and by 1870 he had removed to Wilson Co, NC where he began his practice under the tutelage of Dr. Stephen Woodard. On November 9, 1870, the 26-year old married Mary Virginia Woodard, the 19-yr old daughter of his mentor. The couple set up housekeeping in the Black Creek District of Wilson. The couple would eventually become parents to 3 known children (all sons), 2 of whom became doctors: Dr. Paul Vernon Anderson (1874-1961), Dr. Wade Hampton Anderson (1876-1945), and Steve Woodard Anderson (1880-1953). William was widowed in 1887 when his bride of 17 years died at age 36. Shortly thereafter, he married (2nd) Mary Whitehead who died in 1889, leaving no known children. In about 1897, the 52-year old twice-widowed doctor married for the 3rd and last time to 35-year old Isabell "Bell" Muir Banks of Petersburg, VA. This marriage resulted in the birth of 3 more sons: James Banks Anderson (1899-1941), Lt. Robert Banks Anderson (1893-1918), and Jesse Staton Anderson (1895-1953). Four of William's sons served in World War I. His son, Lt. Robert Banks Anderson, was killed in France during WW I and received the Distinguished Service Cross. "In the attack and defense at Cantigny, France, May 28-30, 1918, he showed utter disregard for his personal safety in leading his command forward in spite of artillery and machine-gun fire. While directing the security of his men after the advance, and in order to make certain that they were protected first, he himself was killed. Next of kin. Dr. W. S. Anderson, Wilson, N. C." He is buried in Grave 153, U S. Military Cemetery, Bonviller Oise, France. In 1905 Dr. Anderson built his home at 316 West Green Street, which still remains today and is considered "one of the most outstanding and the best preserved examples of Colonial Revival architecture in the oldest residential neighborhood of Wilson. It was the home of the prominent Dr. William S. Anderson and his six sons who played an important role in the development of Wilson. The imposing house features a steeply pitched slate roof with dormers and heavy pediments, a Palladian window echoed on the second floor, and columned two-story porch." Dr. William Staton Anderson practiced medicine up until his death, passing on Independence Day, July 4, 1927 at the advanced age of 82. His 3rd wife, Bell Banks Anderson, survived him less than 5 years, passing in 1932 at age 70."</em>

OBITUARY:<em>"Isabell "Bell" Muir Banks was born 1862 in Petersburg, VA, the youngest of 3 known surviving children (2 girls/1 boy) born to Capt. Robert R. Banks, CSA and his wife, Isabell M. Pae. She is the direct descendant of Scottish immigrants on both sides of her family tree, being the paternal grandchild of Thomas Banks (1785-1853) and wife Margaret of Scotland; and maternal grandchild of James Valence Pae (1793-1865) and wife Catherine Allen of Scotland. Both families settled in the Richmond-Petersburg area of Virgina. Her maternal grandfather was a Richmond iron merchant who produced arms for the Confederacy. There is a confederate application for a presidential pardon by James Pae that was written in July 5, 1865 (about a month before his death), that mentions his factory being burnt down during the war and proclaims his allegiance to the United States. Bell's father was a prosperous farmer/merchant in Petersburg who served with Company E, VA 12th, "Petersburg Rifleman". He was wounded at the Battle of Chancellorsville (April 27-May 6, 1863) and his heroics were mentioned in report of Brig. Gen. William Mahone, C. S. Army, commanding brigade: "Among the gallant spirits who were seriously wounded, Captain [Robert R.] Banks, Company E, Twelfth Virginia Infantry, must be mentioned. He fell among the foremost in the skirmish fight of his regiment on the turnpike, May 1, and was at the time commanding our advance guard. His conduct on this occasion was beautifully heroic." Bell was just 9 years old when her father died in 1871 at age 43. Her widowed mother remained on the family farm in Dinwiddie County raising her 3 children. It is not known how Bell and Dr. William S. Anderson met, but in about 1897, the 35-year old became his 3rd wife. She would be mother to 3 of his sons: James Banks Anderson (1899-1941), Lt. Robert Banks Anderson (1893-1918), and Jesse Staton Anderson (1895-1953). Bell was widowed in 1927 when her husband died at age 82. She survived him less than 5 years, passing in 1932 at age 70.
