<a name="one"><strong>1. Richard<sup>1</sup> ADAMS</strong>. His will was made on 19 Aug 1777 and proved in June of 1782 in Richmond Co. NC. 
<p>
There are several references to him among the records of Lunenburg Co. VA. He is included on two lists of tithables taken during the years 1749 and 1750, where he is indicated as either a guardian or employer for Thomas and Richard Shockley, who presumably were related to his wife, <strong>Amy SHOCKLEY</strong>. A transcript of his will appears <a href="raw.html">here</a>.
<p>
Richard ADAMS and Amy SHOCKLEY had the following children:

<a name="two"><strong>2. Richard<sup>2</sup> ADAMS</strong> (<a href="#one">Richard</a><sup>1</sup>). He was granted land in the Cheraws District, 1775, which included Marlboro, Darlington, and Chesterfield Counties SC. He appears as a head of household in the 1790 census for the Cheraws District, SC.
<p>
Richard ADAMS had the following children:
<pre>		i	Richard<sup>3</sup> ADAMS
		ii.	James<sup>3</sup> ADAMS. He was born ca. 1732 and died ca. 1783. He married <strong>Mary MONTGOMERY</strong>.
		iii.	Jonathan<sup>3</sup> ADAMS.

		v.	Elias<sup>3</sup> ADAMS. He was born ca. 1757 and married 
			<strong>Ellen HARLLEE</strong>.</pre>
<p>
<a name="three"><strong>3. William<sup>2</sup> ADAMS</strong> (<a href="#one">Richard</a><sup>1</sup>). He was born ca. 1740. There is a great deal of confusion among his descendants about his and his wife's first names. Several secondary sources from 1897 onward refer to him as "Jonathan" and his wife as "Mary," including a memorial stone erected in his honor in 1941. Nevertheless Anne G. Tindall, one of his descendants has been unable to find a single primary document that refer to them as "Jonathan" and "Mary." She has also found several primary documents that directly or indirectly refer to them as William and Obedience. The most important among these are an extract from some court minutes and an excerpt from his wifes' second husband Luke Robeson's will (see also deed listed under entry for his son 4. William below):
<p>
<cite>"Luke Robeson and Obedience his wife late the relict of Wm. Adams, Deceased came into Court and Prayed letters of Administration and was granted by the Court and gave Solomon Gross and Richard Leveret Bail for their performance in the Sum of Seven Hundred Pounds...  "</cite> (1785 March Court Minutes Richmond County NC)
<p>
<cite>"I Luke Robeson of Marlboro District in the State of South Carolina planter... First I give and bequeath to my dearly beloved wife Obedience Robeson... And I do hereby nominate constitute and appoint My Trusty and well beloved friends and Step sons William Adams, John Adams and Shockly Adams, Executors of this my last will and Testament..." (Children named in will: Jeptha, Samuel, John, Thomas, Leggitt, Christian Chambers, William, Obedience Gibson, Sally Usery, and Mary Slay)"</cite> (Sep 7, 1812 (recorded Dec. 25, 1812) will of Luke Robeson, Apt. No. 8, Package No. 16 Marlboro County Probate Judge office, Bennettsville, SC)
<p>
In addition to this confusion about his name, secondary sources disagree about precisely where he was born. One tradition places his birth in Ireland, while another identifies his place of birth in Amelia Co. VA. In any event, he died in 1783 "within two days march of his home" according to secondary sources. He was SC Private during the Revolutionary War. He attended services at the Quaker Meeting House in Pine Grove, Marlboro Co. SC. 
<p>
<cite>"[William (referred to in this work as Jonathan) ADAMS] probably came from Virginia or Pennsylvania, arrived in North Carolina in 1760.  After remaining in Bladen Co. for some time, he moved on to South Carolina, and was the first Adams to make his appearance in the section of Marlsboro County known as Adamsville.  Tradition states that he is a direct descendant of the Adams family of Quincy, Mass. He fought in the Revolutionary War as a Whig, and when the war ended, while returning home, died only a short distance away. He was buried between Lynch's Creek and the Pee Dee River"</cite> Pate-Adams-Newton (1958)
<p>
<cite>"Jonathan [sic] Adams was of Scotch-Irish descent-The year 1740 is given as the date of his birth and 1760 as the approximate date of his arrival in North Carolina from Ireland. He married Mary Robeson, of Bladon County. She was born in 1742 and died in 1810. She was a daughter of William Robeson and his first wife, Elizabeth. William Robeson was a member of the Convention which met at New Bern on 25 August, 1774; of the Provincial Congress which met at Halifax on 4 April, 1776; and of the Congress which assembled there on the 12th day of the following November. After the adoption of the Constitution he represented Richmond County in the General Assembly - 1789-1790. He went to Virginia and died there in 1800. (It is said he drowned attempting to cross Green Briar River)- He was the son of Peter Robeson and Sarah Farmer of Philadelphia, PA. Peter was the son of Andrew Robeson and Mary Spencer, who came from Scotland to America in 1676. Jonathan Adams finally settled in the most ...part of Marlboro County or Marlboro district of South Carolina. His home, in the vicinity of Adamsville (named in his honor) was near the place now known as the former site of the "Burnt Factory"- a cotton mill built in 1835 and destroyed by fire in 1851. He fought through the Revolutionary War as a Whig. After the struggle had ended, and when within two days march of home, he sickened and died (See History of Marlboro County, by J. A. Thomas p. 27.) He was survived by his wife, three sons, and a daughter. The daughter married James Gibson and died soon afterwards, leaving no children. The three sons were William, Shockley, and John. So far as I know this is the first appearance in the family of the name Shockley."</cite> Notes written by his descendant, William Jackson Adams.
<p>
<cite> "Jonathan [sic] Adams (1740-83) served as a private in the South Carolina Line, from Marlboro County, SC, where he died. He was born in Ireland." There are several other entries of women claiming Jonathan [sic] Adams as their ancestor who make the same claim, but a later entry by Mrs. Vera Kirkwood Crosland states "Jonathan [sic] Adams (1740-83) served as a private  in the South Carolina troops. He was born in Virginia, died in Marlboro County, S.C."</cite> (DAR entry of Mrs. Imogene Underwood Wardle (no. 96451) p. 142).
<p>
William ADAMS married <strong>Obedience -</strong>. She was born ca. 1742 and prior to her marriage lived with her parents in Bladen Co. NC. She died sometime after 1812 (the year her second husband Luke ROBESON signed a will mentioning her). 
<p>
According to secondary sources (e.g. the notes written by William Jackson Adams above), Obedience (referred to as Mary) was the daughter of William ROBESON & Eliza Ann nee HARRIS and married William (referred to as Jonathan) ca. 1762 in Bennettsville, SC. This is also mistaken. Mary ROBESON, daughter of William ROBESON & Eliza Ann nee HARRIS, married - BURKE. We should note further that William and Eliza Ann nee HARRIS ROBESON's daughter Mary was born ca. _1778_, which makes it unlikely they had another daughter named Obedience born 36 years earlier (i.e. 1742).

<a name="four"><strong>4. William<sup>3</sup> ADAMS</strong> (<a href="#three">William</a><sup>2</sup>, <a href="#one">Richard</a><sup>1</sup>). He was born ca. 1764 in Anson (now Richmond) Co. NC. He died 18 Jan 1860 and was buried at the Pine Grove Church, in Marlboro Co. SC. Here’s a <a href="wa.html">photograph</a> of him taken shortly before his death.
<p>
<cite>"William was the eldest of the three [sons of William Adams]. He was born in that part of North Carolina which was formerly embraced in Anson county and afterwards in Richmond when its territory was diminished by the formation of Scotland. I do not know the date of his father's removal to Marlboro district. He died on 18 January, 1859, having lived more than four score and ten. He evidently inherited his father's share of devotion to his country. An obituary relates the following incident of his early life [see obit below] In Thomas's History of Marlboro County, page 111, cited above, the incident is said to have occurred in Marlboro: "...About this time a party of Tories came over from North Carolina into what was then called "Piney Grove" settlement, now Adamsville, and caught a young boy named William Adams, and demanded of him information as to the locality of certain treasure and persons. Adams knew, but determined that it would be wrong to the cause of the country and the safety of his friends to tell what the foe desired to know.  They tried to frighten him. Finally a cord was procured, but Adams was firm. Around his neck they tied it, but no disclosure would he make. The cord was thrown over a limb, and he was drawn up and choked, and let down again and ordered to speak. Still, not a word of information could they extort from his lips. The second time his feet were drawn from the earth. Again they let him down and told him this was his last chance for life. Speak the word and life was his; refuse and hang 'til dead. Firmly he stood. To die was better than to live under a burden of shame. Once more the cruel gang drew him up, tied the cord and went off and left him hanging. Fortunately for him and for Marlboro, too, his mother came along in time to let him down before the life was extinct, and he lived to raise a large family of excellent people, and today a host of young and old people are proud to have descended from him. He was buried at Pine Grove Church, near Adamsville.' William Adams was married four times. His first wife was Mary Marine; the second was Julia Bullard; the third Elizabeth Gibson, a daughter of Nelson Gibson sr., and the third [sic] Patty Easterling."</cite> Notes written by Uncle William Jackson Adams.

OBITUARY:<cite>"MR. WILLIAM ADAMS SEN.  died near Adamsville, Marlboro’ Dist. S.C. on 18th Jan. at the extreme age of nearly 100 years. He was born in Richmond co. N.C. (at which time is not known), but removed to Marlboro’ about the close of the Revolutionary War when about 19 years old. He retained to the last a very distinct recollection of some of the events of the Revolution. One, being of a personal character, is here presented. A party of Tories passing along through Richmond co., in those lawless times, encountered young Adams in the road. He was sitting astride of his dog, so as to keep him from attacking the party. As they rode up, they asked him to tell them where a certain Whig was concealed in the neighborhood. He told them he knew nothing about the man and perhaps said it rather too saucily, for the exasperated feelings of the lawless banditti. For they told him to let the dog go, which he refused to do, and one of them very artfully threw a rope over the youngster’s neck and separated him from his dog, and swung the boy up to a limb, where his life soon would have ended, but for the timely interposition of his mother, who cut the rope before life was entirely extinct. As a man, he was remarkable for his industrious habits and unyielding integrity; always ready in every available way to promote the peace of the community and the interest of the Church. For many years he worshiped with the Quakers; though I do not know that he ever was formally connected with them. In Oct. 1842, he joined the M.E. Church, at Pine Grove, and was baptized at the same time, with one of his sons, who is now travelling in an adjoining Conference. His piety, though not very brilliant, was deep and uniform, and shown with a beautiful simplicity in all the relations of life. For the last few years of his life, he was much afflicted; and for over twelve months before his death he was entirely blind. But in the midst of the afflictions of life, his trust was in his Saviour, and when the time came for his departure, he was ready with “lamp trimmed and burning.” The change came: he is gone. God bless his numerous descendants, and help them to follow him as he followed Christ. B.J.A."</cite> [Southern Christian Advocate, 12 Apr 1860]
<p>
<cite>"There is a marker at the old "Piney Grove" church, located near the Fletcher Memorial School, between Gibson, NC and McColl, SC, erected in 1941 by the Saturday Afternoon Book Club, which has an inscription reading as follows- WILLIAM ADAMS Born 1764 - Died 1855, A Revolutionary hero who at the age of 10, refused to give information of hidden treasure and persons to the Tories, son of Jonathan and Mary Robeson Adams, who were the first Adams to set foot on Marlboro County soil."</cite> (Pate-Adams-Newton) [Note that the year of death is incorrect-his son John P. Adams in a will dated 10 May 1858 and recorded 29 Nov 1858 refers to his father as being alive, a later petition dated 20 Jan 1860 by the executor of this will, Giles Newton specifically refers to William ADAMS as being deceased.]

Larry Cates, a genealogist researching the Bright family, has uncovered the following information suggesting that Obedience ADAMS married <strong>Bassett C. BRIGHT</strong> on 26 Mar 1818 in Marlboro Co. SC. [Whether this represents a second marriage is unclear.]
<p>
DEED RECORD: <em>DB L, p. 40.  Marlborough Dist, State of South Carolina, 25 Nov 1845, I, William Adams, Sr., of Marlborough District, State of South Carolina, give my worthy and true friend, Nelson Gibson of Fayette Co., GA, a negro woman Absey, and her child Margaret in trust for my daughter Beady Bright, wife of Bassett Bright, to have possession with sole and separate use and free from the control of her husband.  w/ L.M. Cobb, JP, James E. Daniel, William Adams, John W. Hill.</em> (Henry Co. Deed Book)
<p>
This pair apparently migrated to Henry Co. GA ca. 1824-26 and raised a family that is included in the 1850 Henry Co. GA census, page 220:

OBITUARY -<cite>"REV. S. D. ADAMS. THIS NOBEL SERVANT OF THE LORD CALLED SUDDENLY AWAY. This community was greatly shocked Monday when it was learned that Rev. S. D. Adams, Presiding Elder of the Warrenton district had suddenly fallen asleep at the residence of W. T. Whitfield.  The decease had been sick for some days, but was up and about his room a few hours before the summons came. Mr. Adams was one of the best known and most beloved of the ministers of the North Carolina Conference, Methodist Episcopal Church, South, having joined the Conference in 1852. He was about 65 years of age, and during his forty-two years in the ministry he was earnest, zealous and prompt in his work in the Lord's vineyard, and though his form we shall no longer see in our midst, his influence will live on forever in the hearts of his people. His death is a great loss to the church which he loved and the flock over which he presided. Appropriate services were held at the residence of Mr. Whitfield Tuesday morning. Rev. R. P. Troy read a lesson from the 4th chapter Second Timothy, after which that dear old hymn "Sweet Bye and Bye" was sweetly sung.  Then, followed an earnest prayer by Rev. Z. T. Harrison of Garysburg. Rev. Troy then made some feeling remarks and appealed to those present to always be ready when the summons comes. Mr. Adams' life had been consecrated to the work in which he was engaged and when he realized that his departure was near at hand he said "Glory, glory, I am ready, I have no preparation to make. Tell my wife it is all right." And then the spark of life went out without a struggle.  Mrs. Adams was at Carthage at the time of his death. One of his sons, Mr. W. J. Adams, came down Tuesday morning and accompanied the remains of his father to his late home at Carthage where he was tenderly laid to rest yesterday. It appears that some days before his death he realized that the time of his departure was not very far off, and as he conducted family worship at the home of Mr. Whitfield, for the last time Sunday night, he selected these words from the 4th chapter of Second Timothy: 'For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: Henceforth there is laid up for me a... Mr. H. B. Adams of Monroe and Mrs. J. D. Creech of Raleigh, attended the funeral of their father, Rev. S. D. Adams last Wednesday. The family of the late Rev. S. D. Adams desire to thank the people of this community for their kindness and their expressions of sympathy and respect in their time of bereavement"</cite> Funeral announcement <cite>"Funeral of S. D. Adams. WELDON, NC, February 13.-Special. The remains of the late Rev. S. D. Adams were taken to his home at Carthage to-day, where they will be tenderly laid to rest to-marrow morning at 11 o'clock. A beautiful and appropriate service was held at the residence of Mr. W. T. Whitfield this morning, before the body was taken to the depot. The pastor of the Methodist church here, Rev. R. P. Troy, made some feeling remarks, and a fervent prayer was offered by Rev. Mr. Harrison, of Garysburg.  Mr. W. J. Adams, a son of the deceased, came down from Carthage to accompany the remains of his father to their final resting place. Mrs. Adams was at Carthage at the time of the death of her husband, and was unable to reach him here in time to see him alive. His last message, however, was consoling. He said to those around him: 'Tell my wife it is all right. I have no preparation to make. I am ready. Glory, glory.' His end was peace."</cite> 2nd obituary <cite>"Rev. S. D. Adams, grandfather of Mrs. W. C. Houston, of Concord, died suddenly at Weldon Monday of heart failure. He was 64 years old and had been in the ministry 42 years.

Adams, Judge W. J. Adams of Carthage and Mrs. J. A. Creech of Portsmouth. Her husband for many years was a presiding elder in the Methodist church.

FIRST OBITUARY - <cite>"MONROE, N.C. TUESDAY, APRIL 27, 1915. MR. HENRY B. ADAMS DIED LAST NIGHT. Prominent Attorney Who Had Been in Bad Health for a Long Time Passed Peacefully Away at One O'Clock This Morning--Funeral To-marrow Afternoon--One of the Best Loved Citizens of Monroe--Had Practiced Law in Monroe for More Than Forty Years. Mr. Henry B. Adams died at his home this morning at one o'clock. While his death cannot be said to have been a surprise, the end was not expected so soon. He had been suffering for a long time with hardening of the arteries, and as long ago as last January he told his family that his mind was at perfect peace, and that he had turned the whole matter over to God. And he died as a Christian philosopher. He was conscious to the last. Not for one moment during the weeks and months he looked upon death as probable at any hour did he show the least disturbance of mind. As far as his health permitted he went about his usual affairs as calmly as if he might be expecting to live many years. He was neither despondent nor hopeless on the one hand nor indifferent on the other. He was simply calm and surrendered to the logic of the situation without a murmur. As his body lies now in repose, dressed in the uniform of a Knight Templar awaiting burial, the features are as peaceful and all but as natural as in life. It is a perfect illustration of the idea expressed by the Hebrew seer-"Oh Death! where is thy sting?" The man who can go down to death like that has achieved a victory of victories. The funeral will be held at the home tomorrow afternoon at three o'clock. Dr. J. C. Rowe and Rev. J. E. Abernathy will conduct the religious service and the Masons will have charge, with the Knights Templar as an escort. The deceased is survived by his wife and six children, all of whom were at his bedside at the last. The daughters were Mrs. W. C. Houston of Concord, Mrs. W. J. Rudge and Miss Pat Adams of Monroe; the sons C. B. Adams, H. B. Adams, Jr., and Dr. Ray Adams.. His aged step-mother survives. His two half brothers are Judge W. J. Adams and Mr. Frank Adams of Carthage. Mrs. Bettie Stewart of Carthage is a full sister. Mrs. Ida Brown of the same place and Mrs. J. D. Creech of Portsmouth, are his half sisters. Long and Useful Life.  Mr. Adams was the dean of the Monroe bar, both in point of age and length of practice. He began the practice here [Monroe, NC] in January, 1872. In all the forty-three years of his practice he followed the law exclusively. He engaged in no other business and though at one time his friends supported him loyally for Congress and almost won the nomination for him, and later for Judge, where he lacked only a small margin of winning, his mind never really diverted from the law. His close study and conscientious practice of the law won the utmost confidence in his judgement and fidelity to trust. He practiced for many years with the late D. A. Covington, and the firm of Covington & Adams carried with the name such a reputation of strength, resource and probity that it lasted long after the partnership ceased to exist. For several years he has practiced with Mr. Frank Armfield and his son, Mr. Hal Adams.  Mr. Adams was the son of the Rev. Shockly D. Adams, and was born in Marlboro county, South Carolina, January 26, 1849. His father entered the North Carolina Conference when he was three years old, and his mother died in Carthage when he was about four years old. After the death of his mother he lived with his uncle in Marlboro, going to county schools, working on the farm, and going to the preparatory schools in reach. He entered Trinity College [later Duke University] and graduated in 1870. He then studied law under Jas. D. Molver and secured license to practice in 1871, locating to Monroe in January of the next year. In April of the same year he married Miss Fannie Person, a step-daughter of Hon. Clem. Dowd of Charlotte.  He early secured the confidence of the people of the county and in 1884 they sent him to the General Assembly, and in 1886 to the Senate from this district. Whatever tokens of honor that came to him, and they were many, came voluntarily. He . He never sought "to stand in" with anything or anybody except so far as a general disposition and an upright character drew friends and admiration to him. He was absolutely unassuming, and of striking appearance, he was as modest, gentle, and approachable as any man. Mr. Adams was a great believer in the fraternal orders and had long been a loyal member of the Royal Arcanum, Knights of Pythias and the Masons. He was once supreme regent for the State in the Royal Arcanum. He held perhaps every office in e in local Masonry from the blue lodge to the Knights Templar, and was a Shriner. For years he was regularly elected chairman of the orphans committee in the local lodge. In this capacity each year he made a special collection for the Oxford orphanage just as certain as Thanksgiving day came. This became such a habit with him that many persons who did not belong to the Masons made sure to have a dollar ready for him on that day.  He was a lifelong member of the Methodist church."</cite> (27 Apr 1915 The Monroe Journal, p. 1); SECOND OBITUARY:<cite> "HON. H. B. ADAMS DEAD. Death Occurred This Morning at His Home in Monroe. Hon. H. B. Adams died this morning at 4 o'clock at his home in Monroe. News of his death was received in a message to his son-in-law, Dr. W. C. Houston.

He was a frequent visitor to Concord and was held in high esteem. Mr. Adams was the son of Rev. S. D. Adams, a member of the North Carolina Methodist Conference. His mother, who died when he was at the early age of about four years, was Martha Fletcher. Henry was born in Marlboro County (then District), near Adamsville, in South Carolina, on the 26th day of January, 1849. When he was about three years of age, his father entered the itinerent ministry as a member of the North Carolina Conference. After the death of his mother, at Carthage, he went to his uncle's in Marlboro, S. C., where he spent his time for a few years in going to the common schools and working on the farm. He spent some time in the academies of the neighborhood of his uncle's during the war, and after the war was at Spring Hill Academy in Richmond, N.C. under the tutorage of John Monroe Johnson. In 1867 he entered Trinity College, N. C., where he remained until he graduated in 1870. After leaving college he studied law with Jas. D. MsIver, who afterward became solicitor of the fourth judicial district. He was licensed to practice law by the Supreme Court of North Carolina in June 1871. In January 1872, he located at Monroe, and engaged in the practice of his profession. In April of that year he was married to Miss Fannie Person. Six children equally divided between the sexes, are the result of the marriage. In 1884 Mr. Adams was elected a member of the General Assembly, where he served with great acceptability. He was in 1886 chosen to go to the State Senate from Union and Anson counties, composing the 27th senatorial district."</cite> (27 Apr 1915 The Daily Concord Tribune p. 1; this same obituary appears in 29 Apr 1915 The Concord Times p. 1); THIRD OBITUARY: <cite>"MR.

NEWSPAPER ARTICLE - <cite>"FAMILY PRESENTS ADAMS MEMORIAL. Beautiful Baptismal Font Given By Sons and Daughters In Honor of Their Parents. The sons and daughters of the late Mr. and Mrs. Henry B. Adams have presented a beautiful baptismal font to the Methodist Church in memory of their parents, devoted members of the church for many years. Mr. Adams, a son of the Rev. Shockley D. Adams, one of the most influential and beloved ministers of the Methodist church in his day, and during his long life as a lawyer Mr. Adams never lost his love and devotion to the church he was born and spent his life. And Mrs. Adams, through her family and her own love was equally devoted to the church. A memorial to them is therefore attested with a special fitness and appropriateness.. The font is chiseled from Italian marble and is the work of a well known artist. It is a very beautiful work of art. The font stands 43 inches high. The square base is 24 inches and the bowl is 20 inches in diameter. From the base rises a column, ornamented with leaves of lilies, supporting a wreath of lilies, on which rests the bowl. On the outer rim of the bowl, these words are etched 'In Memory of Henry B. and Fannie Person Adams.' The font was presented to the church at the Sunday morning  service on behalf of the family by Dr. Weaver, the retiring pastor. It came to the congregation as a surprise.

OBITUARY - <cite>"Mrs. Bettie Adams Stuart 1851-1923. AN APPRECIATION. Paul, in writing the Corinthians, symbolized their lives in these impressive words: 'Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men: For as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but in the fleshy tables of the heart.' What a beautiful letter from Christ has been Mrs. Stuart during the long life she lived, so expressive of His church and community! 'Known and read of all men," in her quiet and unassuming way she has commended Christ to those in sorrow and in sickness as the Friend who never faileth. For years I knew her as a nearby neighbor; and can testify of her unfailing sympathy and good works, for she was always among the first where sickness or sorrow was in the neighborhood, to help and comfort, as the need might be. Of a bright and happy disposition, she always brought cheer and comfort wherever she went. "An epistle written not with ink, but with the spirit of the living God," she lived a life which reflected the light of her Lord and Saviour, in whom she had implicit trust. She had her share of sorrows and afflictions of life, being left motherless when a child, a widow for thirty-six years, having lost her husband and two children; yet through it all she trusted in God, bravely faced the future with the love of God in her heart and a smile on her face,-her life was a living testimony to the sustaining grace of Jesus Christ the Saviour of the World. Mrs. Stuart was faithful to every church duty. She loved her church, she loved the services of the church; and nothing but necessity could keep her from the house of God at the hour of worship. She was deeply interested in all the churches of the community, attending their services when there were no services in her own church. Probably she was more interested in the orphans than in any other cause of the church. Just a few days before her death she put away a sum for the orphans which was a real self-denial on her part. Her sympathy for the orphans was enlarged, no doubt, through her own years of experience in which she found that the goodness of God never faileth. Mrs. Stuart was an epistle of Christ in her home; for she was the mother of one of the sweetest Christian homes it has been my pleasure to know. Her motherhood was enriched and enlarged by the spirit of the living God in her heart, which brought forth in her life those gracious fruits of the spirit in Christian living which are love, joy, peace, long suffering, meekness, goodness, faith, and self-control.  Mrs. Stuart was a rare product of the Methodist Parsonage, being the daughter of Rev. Shockley D. and Martha Fletcher Adams, born February 26th, 1851, in Marlboro County, S. C. Her father was a princely man of God who served faithfully as a minister of the Methodist church, fourteen years on circuits, three years on stations and twenty-five years as Presiding Elder, giving an unbroken service to the ministry of the church of forty-two years; and leaving the influence of his life and character upon scores of communities he served.  Her mother died when she was two years old. Her father later remarried Miss Mary Emaline Jackson, who proved to be a loving and devoted step-mother, taking the place of a real mother in the hearts and lives of Henry and Bettie, her two step-children. She was married to Prof. William James Stuart, of Robeson County, July 1 1869. They made their home in Carthage, where Mr. Stuart was a principal of the Carthage high school for a number of years. It is a matter of historical interest that Mr. Stuart was the first Superintendent of Moore County Public Schools. He made the beginnings of a system, which is now considered one of the best in the State.  The following children were born to this union: Miss E. May Stuart, Miss Lillian Blanche Stuart, Miss Iad Estelle Stuart (now Mrs. W. E. Evans), Mr. William Adams Stuart, Miss Bess Malloy Stuart and Miss Margaret James Stuart. Lillian Blanche and Margaret James have preceded her to their heavenly home. Four children survive her, and the following grandchildren: Mrs. J. Lindsay Savage, Greenville, N. C.; Miss Agnes Evans and Mr. Stuart Evans, Rowland, N.C. She is also survived by the following brothers and sisters: Mr. F. C. Adams, Judge W. J. Adams, Mrs. Ida Bryan, Carthage, N. C. and Mrs. John D. Creech, Norfolk, Va. One brother, Mr. Henry B. Adams, of Monroe, N. C. died in 1915. Mrs. Stuart was apparently in her usual health and activity upon retiring Monday night, November 19th. She awoke the next morning suffering with a severe attack of angina pectoris; and notwithstanding all that faithful doctors and loving hands could do, she went home to God on Friday, November 23. Funeral services were held in the Carthage Methodist church, of which she had been a faithful member for so many years, conducted by her pastor, Rev. G. W. Perry, assisted by Rev. C. F. Clark and Rev. John K. Roberts. Loving hands placed her by the side of her husband in the Presbyterian cemetery to await the resurrection morning. And thus was laid to rest 'A Mother in Israel.'

<p>
BIOGRAPHY - <cite>"Dr. William Cyrus Houston who has practiced his profession continuously in the same office for the past 48 years, and is Concord's oldest dentist, both in age and point of service, is the subject of today's Minute Biography. Dr. Houston, the eldest son of Benjamin Franklin and Mary Elizabeth Hudson Houston, who had been married a few months after the close of the War Between the States, was born on January 2, 1867, on his ancestral farm in Union county in the same room in which, years later, S. Glenn Hawfield, superintendent of the Cabarrus county schools, was born. The farm is still owned by Dr. Houston. The Houston family moved to the town of Monroe when the subject of this sketch was seven years old. He attended school there, graduating from high school in the spring of 1884. That autumn he enrolled in Bingham Military academy, then at Mebane, and finished his course there in 1888. In the fall of 1888, the youth entered Vanderbilt university, Nashville, Tenn., to study dentistry, graduating in 1890, and his first patient was sent to him by the late Dr. W. H. Lilly, whose memory is honored and beloved by many Concord folk. The young dentist was at that time only 23 years old. Dr. Houston returned to his native town for his wife. He was married to Miss Nina Adams, of Monroe, on January 3, 1893, and the two live now in one of the most historic houses in Concord. They have no children. Dr. Houston does not know the exact age of the house, but it is known from old letters that a dance was given there some time in the decade between 1810 and 1820. It is believed to be much older. An inscription outside the house reads as follows: "Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy, fleeing after Lee's surrender on April 19, 1865, spent the night in this house." The historic residence was the former St. James Hotel and for a time was the home of the late Judge W. J. Montgomery. Dr. Houston purchased the property from Dr. M. L. Stephens, who in turn had acquired it from the late J. W. Cannon. In addition to being the dean of Concord's dentists, Dr. Houston has a number of business interests in Concord and Monroe. He is president of the Monroe Hardware company which does a retail business in that city and a wholesale business all over the central section of North and South Carolina. He owns his ancestral farm in Union county which he visits every Wednesday afternoon, and another farm in the Poplar Tent section of Cabarrus county. He was president of the Citizens Building and Loan Association from its organization until four years ago, and has been vice president of the Cabarrus County Building and Loan Association ever since its organization. After the Kerr Bleachery was burned and later reorganized and rebuilt, Dr. Houston became associated with the late W. R. Odell in the venture and has been a director in the company since that time. He has been a director in the Concord National Bank for 15 to 20 years, and has been president of the Concord Telephone company since its organization. For many years Dr. Houston has been a recognized leader in Central Methodist church  and has been active in the establishment of a number of other Methodist churches in the city. He was a member of the board of stewards of Central church for 30 years and is still a member of the board of trustees. He has taught classes in a number of Methodist Sunday schools. In company with the late Dr. Lilly, the late Judge Montgomery and the late D. B. Coltrane, Dr. Houston served on the building committee which directed the remodeling of the Central church. He organized a Sunday school at Westford, and was instrumental in adding church buildings on -- street, Harmony and Westford Methodist churches. Dr. Houston served four years as city treasurer after having been a city commissioner. During his term of office, the city water system was purchased from the late P. B. Fetzer and a great deal of additional equipment installed. He was at the same time treasurer of the city school board. Dr. Houston is a member of the Junior Order of American Mechanics and the Woodmen of the World, and was formerly a member of the Rotary club. His hobby, if he has one at all, is fishing, but he claims no great prowess as a fisherman. Despite the fact that his age is one year past the allotted three score years and ten, Dr. Houston looks much younger and is as active in the business, professional, and religious life of the city as he was in his younger days."</cite> (The Sunday Herald Tribune, 19 Mar 1938)
