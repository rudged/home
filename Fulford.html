<TD VALIGN="TOP"> Abstract: <i> American general biology textbooks often cite the phenomenon of industrial melanism as a particularly well-documented example of natural selection. The phenomenon was introduced into textbooks in the early 1960's in the wake of H.B.D. Kettlewell's pioneering work on the subject, and became ubiquitous throughout the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Textbooks have been criticized for ignoring problems in Kettlewell's original investigations, despite recent work by scientists that broadly supports Kettlewell's initial conclusions. Rudge (2000) has argued that these criticisms, far from undermining use of this example, actually augment its value for science teaching. In a previous paper we drew attention to how visual imagery highlighted features that make it ideal for teaching (Rudge & Fulford, 2011). The current project continues this investigation with an analysis of industrial melanism passages in textbooks from the 1960's to the 2000's. In addition to examining textbooks by decade, three series are inspected for change across time. The analysis determines if the textbooks follow the standard version formulated by Majerus (1998). The analysis also examines what nature of science aspects are included in the passages. The results of the study supports the view that there is a classic textbook account of industrial melanism, and in spite of ongoing research the science content is generally not updated and the nature of science concepts are usually not included.</i></TD></TR>
