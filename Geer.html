<TD VALIGN="TOP"> Abstract: <i>This study reports the extent to which an instructor's involvement in a pedagogic reform project affected his views of teaching and learning.  A characterization of change to his views of teaching and learning as a product of pedagogic reform is presented (i.e. an exploration of the nature of change in views). Findings indicate views of teaching and learning were not greatly affected by change to pedagogic practice in the course of reform. Moreover, identified and explored factors contributing to a relative lack of change in views of teaching and learning included: metaphoric expressions of teaching and learning; reluctance to reflect critically upon teaching practice and change to teaching practice; and, epistemic and role commitments associated with instructional identities across the roles of researcher, faculty member, and instructor of science held by the examined project participant. A model for impacting and understanding outcomes for reform projects seeking to modify views of teaching and learning is suggested.</i></TD></TR>
