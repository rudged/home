9. I am writing as regards information on my Grandfather who died 10 
years ago. He was brought up in Gloustershire by after being 
abandoned on a game keepers doorstep in the grounds of Rudge Hall in 
Gloustershire. My grandfather was brought up as Arthur Smith until he 
got married and found his birth certificate which stated that his 
name was Cyril Rudge. We have no idea about our ancestral history and 
have kept arriving at dead ends as regarding my Grandfathers history. 
We got as far as tracing his mother who was a maid that worked in the 
Hall . If you have any information or can offer any help my family 
would be most interested.

23. John RUDGE Md Sarah TARRY or TERRY c1840. They had 5 Children in Northampton city: William, John Marigold (My direct desendant), Matilda, Edward, Mary Ann, and Elizabeth.
<p>
Although they are listed on the 1841 census.I have not been able to locate John and Sarah's marriage. c1840 in Northanpton. The family appear to have come from Birmingham as John was a gunmaker by trade, a trade allied to Birmingham. John may have moved from Birmingham to Northampton and met and married Sarah on the way. It is possible that Sarah is from a different Parish in Northampton county. The most convenient way to travel from Birmingham to Nortampton would have been by Canal. <p> 
I also believe that they may have moved back to Birmingham at some time as the children appear in various places in Birmingham and Staffordshire in Census records. <p>
My grandfather William George RUDGE emigrated to NZ in 1910 with his future wife Amy DUGMORE.

24. I am interested in the Rudge's from Whitecroft, Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire [Query #12 above]. Julie's Gt Grandfather Henry was a brother to my Gt. Gt. Grandfather Freeman Rudge who was also born in Whitecroft. There parents were John Rudge and Ann Morgan. John was born circa 1805 in Coleford/Newland, also in the forest. Although I haven't got past John for certain (albeit I have a lot of circumstantial evidence to suggest that his parents were a William Rudge and Mary Nicholas who married at Newland in 1791) I have accumulated a lot on information on John and Ann's decendants.

25. I'm trying to trace info about John Arthur Roebuck Rudge. Here's what I have so far:
1. He was an instrument maker from Bath, collaborated with the film
pioneer William Friese-Greene to develop the Biophantic Lantern in 1889.
2. It was in Bath that film pioneer William Friese-Greene made the
acquaintance of John Arthur Roebuck Rudge, a tall gaunt bearded inventor
of magic lanterns. J.A.R. Rudge had devised a latern, the
'Biophantoscope', which could display seven slides in rapid succession,
giving the illusion of movement. So I'm guessing he was born somewhere around 1850/60 and most probably in Bath or Bristol (Friese-Greene's hometown)
3. He possibly died in the early years of the 20th century.

37. I have a very old photograph of someone listed on the photo as JF Rudge and HH or WH Rudge.  They are standing in front of a building known as "JR Fudge Midland Rustic Works". They may be part of my family's genealogy.  As the photo was passed down through my mother-in-laws family, her mother's maiden name was Carrie Rudge.  I believe there are other living Rudges in New York state, USA. It seems that Jane Rudge left England in about 1866 with her 4 children, William, Frederick, Louise and Clara for the U.S.  William and possibly Frederick became printers in New York City, NY, USA.  However, I am not
able to find this branch on your family tree. There are references in Carrie Rudge's records that suggest there are family members buried in the Old
Smethick Church in England. I have requested the church records. Would you be able to point me in the right direction on the connection of JF Rudge, Jane Rudge or William Rudge to the Rudge family history?

39. My grandmother was Matilda Rudge, who married my grandfather, William Thomas Vernon BENNELL.  He was a master plumber who drank away his livelihood and whose apprentices overtook their master. They lived in Salford, and then in Manchester, as far as I know.  Until recently I understood my grandmother had been born in Tarvin, Cheshire.  Imagine my surprise when, while accompanying a
friend to a Mormon Temple to check on her ancestors, I discovered my grandmother had been born near Glasgow, in Lanarkshire, Scotland, in 1864. Try as hard as I can, I can't remember the sound of her voice, which might have told me she had Scottish roots.  Perhaps she migrated south when she was very young, to obtain employment, or maybe the whole family
moved.

We are currently researching our family history and we have so far researched back until 1791.  This is when William Rudge married Mary Nicholls at English Bicknor.  William would be my grandfathers' Great, Great Grandfather. Now that we have reached this point, we are slightly stuck.  We have information about the Rudge family dating back to 1622 in Ruardean, when a Thomas Rudge was church warden.  We are having problems finding a link (if there is one.)

47. I came from the Brazilian branch of the Rudge family. As far as I know, we are direct descendants of John Rudge, since the first generation of the Brazilian branch of the family. My grandfather was Carlos Telles Rudge (son of João Rudge and Ana Telles Rudge), married to Brígida Paredes Estigarríbia Rudge. They had two sons: my father Manoel Luiz Rudge and Fernando Antonio Rudge. Carlos' brothers and sisters were: Antonietta (the pianist), first married to Charles Miller (the introducer of soccer in Brazil), Alcides, Antonio, Plínio, Alfredo, Dila (Rudge Hampshire) and others. I am the only son of Manoel Luiz, who died as an Army Reserve General in 1977. I have two daughters, Elizabet Ramos Rudge (7/13/1958) and Chistine Ramos Rudge (12/21/1963), and a son, Luis Deschamps Rudge (2/21/1988). I was born in 1/32/1936, in Rio de Janeiro. Finally, I have to mention that our coat of arms (probably only of the Brazilian branch) is different from the one you have in your site. And our motto is "Res non Verba" (actions, not words).

49. I was born Anthea Margaret Rudge on 12th January 1942 eleven months before my late father Roland Bernard Rudge went off to fight in North Africa and Italy.  I was 4 when he came home.  My brother, Jeffrey Stephen was born 11th January 1947 and my sister, Susand Elizabeth on 10th October 1953. My father died on 2nd November 1983.  He always wondered about his family.  All we know is that he was born in Edgbaston in 1916 and his father, he was told, was a butcher but he was illegitimate.  This coloured his life a lot.  He said that he remembered when he was about 3 a woman coming to see him (by this time he was with a maiden aunt and her brother) and was told that it was his mother.  He was brought up by the said aunt and uncle in Boxmoor, Hemel Hempstead.  He went on to work with John Dickinson the big paper manufacturer before joining up.  He went to work for Alexander Cowan & Son in Upper Thames Street in London after the war.  He eventually owned his own office stationery and equipment company in Tring in Hertfordshire. If you know of any family members with whom my brother, sister or I could get in touch with to try and throw some light onto our father's past I would be grateful.

74. My mother's maiden name is Rudge and her great grandfather came to Australia in 1833 as a Convict. I have successfully traced all descendents in Australia, but when it comes to going back further in England, I'm not sure where to start. This is as much of the early detail that I have been able to piece together from death & marriage certificates etc. George Henry Rudge was born around 1814 in Gloucestershire (no details of town or village). His parents were Benjamin Rudge (farmer) and Charlotte (formerly Rudge). He was sent to Australia in 1832 for 7 years for stealing rabbits. The date of his trial was 30/3/1832 in Gloucester. He sailed to Australia on the barque "Camden" which:<p>
Departed Sheerness, England   22/9/1832<p>
Arrived Sydney, NSW           18/2/1833<p>
Voyage time                   149 days<p>
Ship's Master                 George T Clayton<p>
Ship's Surgeon                        Joseph Steret<p>
200 males left England, 2 died on the voyage<p>

He was 17 years old at the time, 5'7" tall, ruddy complexion, brown hair, dark grey eyes and the letter "R" branded inside his lower right arm He also had two blue bands on the middle and third finger of his right hand. His occupation was listed as a "Farmer's Boy".

97. I am researching my Rudge family history which has led me to Edgmond, Longford and Sheriffhales in Shropshire. I would be very interested to hear from anyone with links to this line. Names that I know of include Thomas Swift Rudge who married Mary Ann Banks & lived in Wolverhampton. He was born 1830 in Edgmond. His father is Joseph Rudge born 1803 in Sheriffhales and married Eleanor Walford. His father is Thomas Rudge born 1768 in Sheriffhales and married Mary Bryan. His father is John Rudge who died in 1778 in Sheriffhales, and married Elizabeth Plant in Kemberton in 1750. Any assistance with the ancestors and descendants of this line will be greatly appreciated.

99. My grandfather was William Rudge born in Birmingham England May 28, 1890 and died in St Catharines, Ontario Canada May 21, 1955. He was married to Ethel May Fisher born April 7, 1891 in Litchfeild England. My Dad was the oldest of their five children and was born in Litchfield on September 23, 1917. The family immigrated to Canada in 1919.
We do not have any further ancestral information other than other members of the family that we have pictures of are Jack Rudge, Harry Rudge ( has a daughter Winnie) Emma Rudge (Grandad's sister I think) and a Frank Rudge (Grandad's younger brother)
Uncle Jack had a florist shop in Birmingham on Pershore Rd in the early 1900's (A J RUDGE) is on the store sign. If any of this information coincides with information that you have found, I would be most greatful to hear from you. Thank you for your help.

103. I am researching a Rudge family who came to Stratford upon Avon in the late 1700's.  I know that Joseph Rudge had a glass shop and carriers business in 1796 but was run over and killed by his own cart between Stratford & Warwick in approx. 1801. The Carriers business was then carried on by William Rudge and his wife Ann. They had  five sons Joseph, James, John, William & Thomas.  James born 8th July 1809 from whom I am descended took over the carriers business and he married Hannah Mitchell 08/04/1839. They had 3 children James b07/09/1844, Lucy b04/04/1847 & Thomas b30/06/1849.  On the cessation of his carriers business James built a house in 1851in the Shipston Road in Stratford and then converted it to a pub called the Railway Inn (now TheTramway Inn) in 1861.  His daughter Lucy (my great grandmother married William Such and moved to Evesham), Thomas is shown on the 1901 census as in the St Pancras area of London but no trace of James after the 1891 census. I am trying to find where the family came from prior to coming to Stratford. Also what happened to James b07/09/1844  who seems to have disappeared after the 1891 census although he may have gone to America and are any of  the descendants of Thomas b30/06/1849 researching their Stratford roots.

114. Rich. NEW and Kath. RUDGE, married 30 Oct 1739, All Saints', Evesham, Worcestershire, England. This reference came from the volumes of Worcestershire Marriages in Worcester Family History Centre. The RUDGE name is interesting because it is the family name of the Squires of Evesham - Lords of the Manor of Evesham - which perhaps they were then but were certainly so later. I know of three Richard NEWs there in Evesham or nearby at that time. Two can be eliminated because I know of their marriages and descendants. If it is the third, Richard, a son of Edward New and Margaret Freeman, then they had a daughter Hannah (named in Edward's Will of 1753/4). Incidentally, this Richard is incorrectly identified in the I.G.I. as the progenitor of a NEW family of Defford and Eldersfield. The Y-DNA doesn't match between those of us from the Evesham NEW family and a representative of this Defford family. Can anyone identify Kath Rudge?

124. I'm currently researching my Rudge family tree based around the Oldham area in Lancashire. There seems to be a few links with surrounding families, such as my grandfather, James Rudge married Alice Smallwood, who was somehow related to Benjamin 'Benny' Gibson who passed away after an accident around the late 1930's. His sister Sarah Gibson who married Thomas Tideswell and had a son named Roy. There was also a Margaret who married a Mr. Reynolds. On my grandfathers side was his sister, Lucy Rudge. Their father was Tom Rudge that lived in Chadderton around the late 1800's. Toms father was James Rudge (The 'James' name seems to be a tradition to be passed down in our family that skips a generation). I have a book that belonged to Tom, with photos that seem to be dated back to the 1700's, but with no titles or names, I've no idea who they are. If anyone could help, please get in touch.

128. I think I am a direct descendant of a line of the Rudge family which I can trace back to Bridstow, near Ross on Wye in 1663 when <strong>William Rudge</strong> married Blaunch A. - (the surname is impossible to read in the Parish Register). William and Blaunch had Joan (1665), Walter (1667), <strong>William</strong> (1671) and Mary (1674). William married Margaret Sharp at Bridstow in 1689 and had James (1690), Thomas (1692), William (1696), and </strong>John</strong> (1702). John married another Margaret (not sure where she came from) and had John (1725), Sarah (1727), <strong>William</strong> (1729). William married Ann Taylor at Ross on Wye in 1756 and had <strong>William</strong> (1763), Mary (1764). William married Elizabeth Mathews in 1788 at English Bicknor (across the county boundary in Gloucestershire) and had Sarah (1790), <strong>William</strong> (1792), James (1794), John (1796), Thomas (1799) and George (1803). William married Mary Merrick at Marstow (back across the River Wye into Herefordshire) in 1819 and had George (1819), William (1824), <strong>Edward</strong> (1827), Helen (1829), Eliza (1832), John (1834), Emily (1841) and Amos (1842). Edward married Eliza Phillips at Marstow in 1849 and had <strong>Albert</strong> (1852), Emily (1854), Edwin (1856). Albert married Sarah Ann Lewis in Hereford in 1875 and had <strong>Henry</strong> (1876), Edwin (1880), Emily (1881), Helen Winifred (1883), Albert Lewis (1887), Rosalind (1883) and Ernest. Henry married Maria Jenkins in Abenhall ((in Gloucestershire) in 1907 and had <strong>Henry</strong> (known as Harry) in 1908, Rene (1913) and Ruby (1915). Harry married Joan Clark in Perival, Middlesex in 1939 and had <strong>Stephen</strong> in 1949 – that ' s me. I would like to hear from anyone who is connected to this line. I think some descended from the 1790 ' s family at English Bicknor, and the 1820 ' s/1830 ' as family at Marstow (and later Whitchurch in Herefordshire) may have reached USA and Australia.

131. I am seeking information about the relationship between two members of the Rudge family in Australia. These two men were both landholders at Carrick in Tasmania in the 1840s, and were both brewery owners and innkeepers in Tasmania. It has been said that they were brothers, a claim that I am seeking to verify. My interest stems from research into the brewing industry in Tasmania, not from any family connection. John Rudge, born c.1813, was convicted at Middlesex and sentenced to transportation for seven years. He arrived in Van Diemen’s Land in 1830. He moved to the Port Phillip District (now Victoria) in 1846, and died there in April 1848. Frederick Rudge, born c.1820, operated the same brewery at Carrick, Tasmania, that had previously been operated by John Rudge before his move to the mainland. An obituary of George Caleb Rudge (born 1855), a son of Frederick, states that Frederick was an officer of the East India Company. Were there two men really brothers? If not, what was their relationship? Any leads will be appreciated.

133. My name is Linda Judd, nee Rudge. After my brother, Edwin Paul Rudge's sudden death last year, I have felt rather 'out on my own'. My brother was the last member of my family. Our father was Robert Alexander Rudge who died in 1993 at the age of 80. His parents were Caroline Josephine Jenkins and Edwyn Ross Rudge. They were married at St Paul's Parish Church, Ealing in1912. On their  Wedding certificate, Grandpa's (Edwyn) Father is down as Charles, deceased. Gentleman. That is where the trail stops. As a child I was told by Grandpa, that they lived in a big house and it took 2 "servants" to close the door at night? Other family conversations, which I overheard, were that Grandpa, had, had a falling out with his family. He wanted to pursue a trade, which was not done, and so went his way and I gather was disinherited. He became an Electrical Engineer (1911 Census = Edwyn Ross Rudge) After marriage to my Grandmother, they boarded a ship to New Zealand on 24th January, 1913. My Father, Robert was born later that year: 12th November, 1913. I have a copy of a Family Tree, that was Grandpa's, then Dad's. The Family was De Rugge, then later Rudge.

134. I'm trying to locate my ancestors of the Rudge Family. My ancestors name is Charles William George Ridge born in 1844. My grandmother, Nelly Catherine Rudge Foti, traveled to london in 1976 to trace our family to the Evesham Rudges and we only found one living adopted cousin Anthony J. De Nouaille Rudge born 1930_1931, he was adopted as as Rudge. Any way, I've tried to look him up based on the research paperwork from the Evesham Historical society done in Nov 1976 stating he was the only living relative of our Evesham branch. My little brother, whom is not so little anymore, contacted a professor who studies royal families and said that they thought our side of the rudges who live in the states died off. My grandmother made me promise when she died in 2011 that I would travel to london update our ancestry and have another family crest made for my generation. I have letters when my grandmother worked at the Pentagon and correspondent to the King of Arms and letters/pictures of when she had tea with the Queen of England. I have all the documentation that I need to update everything and my grandmother's documents proving that we are in fact the rudges of evesham. Now Anthony rudge is about 85 and he has no children and my grandmother gave him permission the collect the royalties and take care of whatever needed to be taken care of when he lived in Churchover, Rugby, Worcestershire. I looked him up and found out he currently lives in Wigginton, Banbury, Oxfordshire. I tried looking up his telephone number but it's not listed. I wanted to ask his help since he helped my grandmother with the petitions for our family. My husband and I are traveling to Evesham to visit and I just wanted to see where we all came from and my history. I have already contacted Evesham Historical Society asking asking for information but haven't heard back yet. I'm the oldest granddaughter and I'm trying to make it to where we don't lose what little info we have left. I am living in Spain on military orders and about to start a family so any pointers of exactly where we fit into this family tree would be helpful.
