<p>
<a href="#three">3. Thomas WEBBER</a> <em>"was a mariner of Boston as early as 1644 if not sooner, and the master of the sloop "Mayflower", while still resident in England in 1652. He may have been related to the Thomas Webber who was a Puritan and Adventurer-- in fact, they could be one and the same man.  By 1660 there were approximately 8 known ships bearing the name 'Mayflower.' The ship mentioned above is not the same 'Mayflower' of 1620... At one time, some unscrupulous individuals attempted to make some fast money from the descendants of Thomas Webber, Sr. Apparently, he once held a deed to land in N.Y., probably at a time when it was New Netherland. He may have taken land land deeds in payment for goods that had been shipped into the new world. At any rate, some sly genius calculated that this land was now in the heart of New York City and persuaded the descendants to band together to claim 1 foot of land on Wall Street. However, after investigating, it was found that Thomas Webber's claim to any land in NY took place so long ago that it was impossible to describe the present land, let alone prove that his right existed. Needless to say, many descendants lost a great deal of money in legal and investigation fees... So all descendants of Thomas Webber should be aware of this scheme to get rich quick does exist, and you are their targets, even today."</em> [<i>The Legend of Lazarus Rowe</i>, pp. 120-121, by Mary Palmer. This story is often told with reference to a Wolfert Webber, who is often mistakenly styled as the progenitor of this family. An extensive discussion of this controversy, as well as the alleged claim that this Webber family extends from royalty is available <a href="http://www.otal.umd.edu/~walt/gen/htmfile/3854.htm">here.</a>]
