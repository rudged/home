<center><h3>Descendants of William Rudge of London and Portsea, England</h3></center>
<p>
The following is a genealogy of a Rudge family that migrated from England to North Carolina by way of France. It is based on over thirty years of research using primary documents (baptism, census, marriage and death records etc.) as noted below. There are also several newspaper accounts and other items of family history. My quest to learn about this family has been inspired by the following passage from a letter written to me by a second cousin:  
<p>
<cite>"Among these stories, that I haerd [sic] when I was in high school, was that our Rudges had left the West of England toward the end of the eighteenth century and lived for a time near London. One of them went to India and was connected with the East India Company."</cite> (letter from Kenneth Rudge Wilson Jones to David Rudge 20 Mar 1983)
<p>
and another letter rediscovered in October 2009:
<p>
<cite>"Grandfather John Rudge was also the engineer of the steam boat which carried Napolean's body up the Seine river & deposited it in his tomb at the Hotel D'Invalides, Paris, after bringing the body back from St. Helena. I do not know when Uncle John was born or the date. But Mother was born in France (Nantes) Jan 2-1851 [died April 18 1905] There were only these two children. Grandfather Rudge was born in London Eng April 7 1821 & Buried in Wilmington, NC. 
Grandmother Rudge was Louisa Mitchell Born Portsmouth Hampshire Eng. Jan 8 1822 died 1906 Sav'ah. Great grandmother & father Thomas Mitchell was born Fifershire Scotland Sept 30 1800. Died Sept 20-1871. Eliza Linnington was born New Port, Isle of Wight Eng July 10th 1799 died Oct 10 1862."</cite> (extract from a letter to Katherine Erma nee Rudge Griffith from Maud nee Banks Kaufmann dated 22 Dec 1956)

<a name="one"><strong>1. William<sup>1</sup> RUDGE.</strong> He was born ca. 1778 and was baptized on 6 Jan 1778 at Smethwick, Staffordshire, England. According to the record of his son Edward Rudge's second marriage (below), William died on 16 Jul 1823. He was buried on 17 Jul 1823 at the Deadman's Place Independent Chapel [St. Saviours] on Union Street, Southwark, London, England. Baptism records for his children refer to him as an "engine worker", "laborer" and an "engineer." 
<p>
I have determined that the following Smethwick baptism record refers to William on the basis of the following evidence. First, he and his wife Hannah have two children who are both baptized in Smethwick, Staffordshire, England. I contend that the reason why William and Hannah traveled from London to Smethwick was that William had family there. The date of the baptism 6 Jan 1778 is consistent with his marriage date (he would have been 21). The record of his burial specifically states he was 45 at the time of his death in 1823 (i.e. born ca. 1778). Smethwick is in the West of England. Finally, there is a broad similarity in naming patterns of children (William's second son was named Samuel, all three of his daughters were baptized with the name Elizabeth as either a first or middle name). Information about William's ancestry appears <a href="http://homepages.wmich.edu/~rudged/gen/srudge.html">here</a>.
<p>
BAPTISM RECORD: <cite>"6 Jan 1778  William son of Samuel & Elizabeth Rhudge"</cite> (Baptism Records for Smethwick, Staffordshire, England; LDS Batch no. C061732, Sheet 00, Source no. 0421591, Printout 1037057).
<p>
William married <strong>Hannah TAYLOR</strong>, daughter of <strong>Richard Grove(s) TAYLOR</strong> and <strong>Ann -</strong>, on 8 Jun 1799 in the Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark, Surrey England. In the record William is identified as of full age (i.e. 21 or older), a "Bachellor" and "of this parish." According to the marriage bond, he had been living in the parish for at least the last four weeks. Hannah must have been born about 1779, as she is identified in the marriage bond as a minor "Nineteen years and upwards" and of the same parish. 
<p>

Here's an image of the <a href="wrmar.html">index card</a> to this marriage.
<p>
Baptism records (below) indicate that William's family moved around in the London area, spent some time in Smethwick, Stafford Co. and Portsea, Hampshire Co. England, and then returned to London. <p>
<p>
On 28 Feb 1821 William gave expert testimony with regard to the water supply to London that has been preserved in a record of committee hearings held by Parliament. In this record he identifies himself as "Engineer of the Southwark waterworks" (Parliamentary Papers, by Great Britain, Parliament, House of Commons, Published by HMSO, 1821, Reports from Committees (2) Bread, Supply of Water to the Metropolis; London Bridge; &c. Session 23 January to 11 July, 1821. Vol. V., pp. 68-69).
<p>
A record of his son Edward Rudge's third marriage (below) specifically refers to him as the late William Rudge who died in the Parish of Saint Saviour, London on 16 Jul 1823. This is confirmed by the following burial record:
<p>
BURIAL RECORD: <em>"1823... July... 17 William Rudge aged 45 years St. Saviour"</em> Register of Burials at Deadmans Place Independent Chapel on Union Street, in the parish of Southwark, London from 1805 to 1837. RG4/Piece 4360/Folio 94. Here's an <a href="wb.html">image</a> of the record.
<p>
After William died, Hannah apparently married <strong>Thomas ADAMS</strong>, father of her son-in-law, John ADAMS by her daughter, Ann Elizabeth nee RUDGE. Hannah's second marriage took place on 26 Mar 1837 at the Parish of St. George in the East, Stepney, Middlesex. She is referred to as a "widow", and he as a "widower." She appears with her husband Thomas as witnesses in records of her daughter Sarah Elizabeth RUDGE's marriage to Matthew POLLINGTON on 30 Jul 1838 in the Parish of St. George in the East, Middlesex, and also her son John RUDGE's marriage to Louisa MITCHELL on 9 Nov 1842 in the Parish of Westham, Essex, England. 
<p>
In the 1841 census for  Church Street Buildings in West Ham there is a record of a Thomas Adams (age 60-64), his wife [H]Anna[h Taylor Rudge] Adams (age 60-64) a son (by his first marriage), John Adams (aged 30-34) , John's wife Ann [Elizabeth Rudge] Adams (age 30-34) and their two children Maryann (age 2) and Eliza (age 3 mos). Eliza is the only one listed as having been born in the county of Essex, all the others are explicitly referred to as not having been born in that county. Neither Hannah nor Thomas appears in the 1851 census for Westham among the members of John ADAMS family (below).

<a name="two"><strong>2. William<sup>2</sup> RUDGE</strong> (<a href="#one">William</a><sup>1</sup>). He was born on 8 Dec 1800. He was baptized (1) on 15 Dec 1800 in St. Dunstan, Stepney, Middlesex, and (2) six months later on 28 Jun 1801 at St. George the Martyr in Southwark, Surrey. He died on 28 Jan 1859 in Le Havre, France and was buried on 30 Jan 1859 in the St. Helene cemetery, Le Havre, France. He was an engineer.

According to a civil record of his death, William married <strong>Ann EDMONDS</strong> on 10 May 1824 at the Parish of St. Dunstan, Stepney, Middlesex.

<p>
According to his death and burial records (below), that given the date and place of birth undoubtedly refer to him, he ultimately migrated to Le Havre France, presumably after his marriage to Ann. The burial record identifies him as a widower and therefore he may have had children, none of whom was apparently baptized at Le Havre. (There are also no references to births of children to William and Ann among those indexed for the London area during the time period they were alive.)
<p>
An 1840 ship's manifest for the Normandie, the steamship charged with carrying Napolean's body lists William, son of William Rudge and Ann Tailor [sic] as a "mecanician" (engineer), with his brother John being identified as "chauffeur" (the person responsible for maintaining the furnace of the steam engine.

<p>
BAPTISM RECORD: <em>"1807. Edward S. of Wm. & Hannah Rhudge Jan. 1."</em> (Parish Records of Smethwick, Stafford, LDS Batch C061732 421591). This is the only baptism record I was able to find of an Edward Rudge son of William and Hannah that is age appropriate. (It is precisely the birth year it should be to be consistent with the one record we have that identifies Edward's age, 52,  mentioned in a 1859 record of death for his brother, William Rudge (above), in which Edward is identified as a witness. The record of Edward's third marriage also refers to him as having been born in Smethwick, Stafford.) The connection to Smethwick suggests a possible set of parents for his father, William. This is discussed in detail <a href="srudge.html">here</a>.
<p>
Edward first married <strong>Caroline BLINDELL</strong>, daughter of John Blindell, on 24 May 1826 at St. Nicholas, Deptford, Greenwich, Kent. She was born in 1806 and died ca. 1843.

Edward and his first wife migrated to Le Havre France, as witnessed by the baptisms of two children and a record of the burial of a third. Caroline apparently died ca. 1843.

Edward second married <strong>Matilda Emma nee McDonogh LAMAIRE</strong> on 17 Jan 1844 at Southampton, Hampshire, England. She was born ca. 1809 and died at Le Havre, France in April 1847. She was buried on 26 Apr 1847 at St. Helene churchyard, Le Havre, France.

The index entry for this record identifies "Maria Ford" as single and the daughter of John Ford. It also identifies the groom, Edward Rudge, as a widower and son of William Rudge. Marie was born ca. 1809 in Southwark, England. Marie nee FORD RUDGE died on 28 Dec 1851 in Caen, France. There is no indication Edward had any children by her among the civil records of Le Havre, France.

This Marriage was solemnized between us, John Rudge [and] Louisa Mitchell, in the Presence of us, Thomas Adams and Hannah Adams."</cite> 
<p>
Baptism records for their first three children suggest that John and Louisa migrated to Le Havre, Seine Maritime, France shortly after their marriage with several other members of their family, including John's older brothers William and Edward, his older sister Sarah Elizabeth nee Rudge Pollington, their families and Louisa's parents, Thomas and Eliza Mitchell. They returned to the parish of St. George in the East, Middlesex, England, as witnessed by records of the deaths of two of their children, and then returned to Le Havre, where according to tradition (referred to by Kenneth Rudge Wilson Jones) John worked on the rebuilding and repair of the port. There is a record of his son John William's birth in Le Havre, Seine Maritime, and also their daughter Mary Louisa's birth in Nantes, Loire Atlantique, France (noted below). The family appears in the 1851 census for Nantes.
<p>
A "laving up list" (reference 120j27292) of the crew of the steamboat "La Bretagne", which was built in Le Havre in 1843 and engaged in offshore coastal traffic between Nantes and Lisbon under Captain Blanchent refers to John as follows: <i>Left from the port of Nantes on 29 May 1854 and returned on 14 August 1854, John Rudge, chief mechanic, living in Nantes, born in Great Britain, age 39 years old, Hair and eyebrows blond, high forehead, ordinary nose, middle mouth, heavy chin and oval face. Wages 250 francs per month."</i>
<p>
A note quoted verbatim at the top of this page claims John was the chief engineer on a steam boat charged with bringing Napolean's body back to France in 1840. He would have been 18 at the time. It is possible this is a reference to his father, who was an engineer.
<p>
<cite>"As you already know our great grandfather (your great great) John William Rudge was born in Le Havre, (France) while his father was engaged as an engineer in the rebuilding of the port. I have a daguerreotype of him and his older brother Thomas taken there, probably in about 1852-1855. I also recall that when they entered this country they came to Philadelphia first, then Savannah. There may be records of entry there in the immigration office. Mamma Carrie (my grandmother) and Aunt Kate always kept little bits of French phrases that they used to hear as children from this episode."</cite> (letter from Kenneth Rudge Wilson Jones to David Rudge 20 Mar 1983)
<p>
<cite>A descendant, William Jerome Rudge Jr. claimed that the early Rudges, like other immigrants, were trying to get away from poor economic conditions, "crooks and robbers" from England, outcasts who came for a new start. His daughter in law, Beverly Anne Cook Rudge, distinctly remembers him telling about the family's immigration from England. Someone was carrying a little boy up a gang plank  The boy fell into the ocean and was fished out by someone, thus ensuring the Rudges made it to America."</cite>
<p>
I have located an immigration record (ship manifest) that refers to our John Rudge and his family and also a newspaper account of the arrival of the ship that appears in the 8 Nov 1858 issue of the <i>New York Times</i>. According to the newspaper article, they migrated aboard the ship Wm. Frothingham on 10 Sep 1858 from Le Havre, France. They ultimately arrived at the port of New York on 6 Nov 1858. On the ship's manifest are listed John Rudge (age 36), Louise Rudge (age 36), Mary Rudge (age 8 [sic]) and John Rudge (age 6 [sic]). An image of this immigration record is located <a href="immigration.html">here</a>. A website devoted to the history of the ship that carried them, including an image of a portrait of the ship painted ca. 1875-1877, is located <a href="http://www.zurita.com/WmFrothingham/">here</a>.
<p>
John and his family appear in the 1860 census for Wrightsville Sound (Wilmington), New Hanover Co. NC taken in August next to his in-laws, Thomas and Eliza nee LINNINGTON MITCHELL. John and his wife are both listed as 38 years old and born in England; his son John William and daughter Mary Louise are listed as 11 and 9 years old respectively, both born in France.
<p>
John died of consumption on 30 Dec 1860 according to the original <a href="ir.html">interment record</a>. The record also indicates he was 38 years and 9 months old at the time of death, born "In England", died "In Wilmington", and buried in the Public Ground.

<p>
After the death of her husband (ca 1860-61) Louisa and her children migrated to Columbia, Richland Co. SC , where, according to an application for membership into the United Daughters of the Confederacy written by her granddaughter (Katherine Erma Rudge) transcribed below under the entry for her son, <a href="#twenty-nine">John William</a>, ran away from home to join the Confederacy. Why she moved to Columbia and what she did during the Civil War are unclear, but in any event she and her daughter Mary Louise returned to Wilmington shortly thereafter where they reunited with her son. 
<p>
CITY DIRECTORY: <cite>"Rudge, L. Rudge res. s. w. cor. Market & 7th"</cite> (William H. Bernard's Wilmington and Fayetteville Directory 1866-'7, p. 96.)
<p>
On 18 Aug 1866, Louisa and her two surviving children were received by the Grace Methodist Episcopal Church, also known as the Front Street Station M.E. Church South, in Wilmington, New Hanover Co. NC "on profession of faith in Christ." She is also mentioned as a member on a list of church members dated Nov 1869 and 1870, the latter mentioning that she and her daughter were "removed by certificate in Feb 1873". Louisa moved in with her daughter's (Mary Louise RUDGE (BANKS)) family in Wilmington, New Hanover Co., NC (1870 census), where she is referred to as "Louisa Roger" age 48. 
<p>
Shortly afterwards, Louisa apparently migrated with her son, John William, to Monroe, Union Co. NC ca. August 1875 when he opened a tin shop. She briefly went into business with her daughter-in-law, Caroline Virginia nee PAE RUDGE, as a dress maker. An early announcement suggests Louisa had been living in Monroe for some time prior to the opening of the store on 24 Apr 1877.
<p>
ANNOUNCEMENT OF STORE OPENING - <em>"MILLINERY AND DRESS MAKING. Mrs. L. and Mrs. Carrie V. Rudge, we understand, will open, at an early day, a millinery and dress making establishment in the room recently occupied by Mr. J. S. Lucas. Goods are already bought and will be here in a few days. Circulars announcing day of opening will be distributed shortly. Mrs. L. Rudge has been working here for some time in the dress making department and has displayed much taste and experience in her work."</em> (16 Apr 1877 Monroe Enquirer p. 3)
<p>
AD FOR STORE - <em>"MILLINERY GOODS.-Mrs. Rudge."; "NEW STOCK OF MILLINERY GOODS. New Opening on Tuesday April the 24th. Mrs. L. Rudge and Mrs. Carrie V. Rudge respectfully call the attention of the citizens of Monroe and surrounding country to the fact that they will have ready for exhibition at their Millinery Store, next door to Stewarts Clothing store, on Tuesday the 24th inst, a fine and select stock of Ladies and Childrens Hats and Bonnets trimmed and untrimmed, Ribbons, Trimmings, Flowers and Millinery Goods generally. A Dress making department is in connection with the above, where customers can be accommodated on short notice, in fashionable styles, and low prices. A call is respectfully solicited."</em> (23 Apr 1877 Monroe Enquirer p. 3)
<p>
The Monroe Enquire features weekly ads for the store with Louisa's name through 13 Oct 1877, after which time subsequent ads only mention her daughter-in-law.
<p>
Louisa subsequently moved back to live with her daughter (Mary nee RUDGE BANKS), and shows up with them in an 1880 census entry for Baxley, Appling Co., GA (1880 census). The family ultimately ended up in Savannah, Chatham Co. GA. Louisa appears as a separate entry in several Savannah City directories (1883, 1884, 1893, 1894, 1896-1906), most of which refer to her as the widow of J. Rudge. According to the 1883 and 1884 Savannah city directories, Louisa worked as a housekeeper for a hotel called Screvens House.[Home of commercial travel on Johnson Square. Rooms were $2.00-3.00 per night.] Louisa apparently moved around a great deal within the city, as almost no two entries in these directories give the same address. She curiously does not appear in the soundex index for the 1900 census for Savannah.

NEWSPAPER ARTICLE DETAILING AN INTERVIEW SHE HAD: <cite>"FORTUNE GOES BEGGING. A SAVANNAH LADY THE SUPPOSED HEIRESS TO $100,000. Mrs. Rudge, Formerly of England, Sought for by Chancery Attorneys With an Estate to Dispose of - A Slight Difference in Names and Localities All That Stands in the Way of Her Assuming the Property - A Chat With Mrs. Rudge. EKINS-RUDGE-MRS. RUDGE, FORMERLY of Great Barford, Bedfordshire, England, (nee Ekins), if living, or her children if dead, may bear of something to her advantage by applying to PATTISON, WIGG & KING, solicitors, 11 Queen Victoria st., London, or to J. ARTHUR BARRATT, Consellor [sic] -at-Law, 11 Pine st., New York. This advertisement appeared in Sunday's New York <i>Herald</i>. The <i>Herald</i>, in commenting upon it says: It appears from the information imparted by Mr. Barratt to a Herald reporter that Mrs. Rudge, whose maiden name was Ekins, accompanied her husband to Canada about twenty years ago, and subsequently coming with him to this country, settled down either at Washington or somewhere in the neighborhood. Since then nothing has been heard of Mrs. Rudge by her relatives, and she is now being sought in order that she may claim her share of an estate left by a bachelor relative. This relative died about twenty-five years ago, and his estate got into chancery. After a great number of years had passed, a settlement was effected, not, however, before the estate had been well taxed for legal expenses. The money has since been distributed among the family, and Mrs. Rudge is entitled to her share- a quite considerable one if she can furnish the proper proofs of her identity. Mr. Barratt represents the London solicitors and will conduct an examination of all claimants that present themselves in this city. If the proofs are satisfactory the property will be transferred to the claimants. MRS. RUDGE IN SAVANNAH. The name of Rudge is by no means a common one, and friends of Mrs. Louisa Rudge, of No. 32 Henry street, in this city, believe that the description is imperfect and that it refers to Mrs. Rudge, of Savannah. A MORNING NEWS reporter had a very pleasant interview with Mrs. Rudge yesterday at the residence of her daughter, Mrs. John Banks. She is a typical English lady of 67 years, with hair white as the driven snow, but it is no index of her vigor, for in conversation and carriage she seems ten years younger. Mrs. Rudge says that her attention was called to the Herald advertisement and comments by a family friend, Mr. H. C. Houston. She was not prepared to believe that she was the person referred to for two reasons. One is that her maiden name was Mitchell, and second, that she never resided in Canada. It was true, however, that she had relatives in England, and there were proceedings in chancery by relatives of her husband before he died. That, however, was in Staffordshire, and not in Great Barford. A NEIGHBOR OF CHARLES DICKENS. Mrs. Rudge was the daughter of Thomas Mitchell, and her husband's father was William Rudge, a famous engineer. Charles Dickens, she says, lived right across from the old place of the Rudges, and the name of a leading character in one of the great novelist's works she thinks may have been suggested by that fact. She says she married John Rudge Nov. 9, 1842, and showed the certificate of the Parish Clerk, which sets forth that John Rudge and Louisa Mitchell were united in marriage on that date in the parish church of West Ham, Essex county. Her husband was also a celebrated engineer, and the couple resided in Spain, France and Italy, and in October, 1858, emigrated to this country, settling at Wilmington, NC. Her father had come over from England six years before, and owned a watering place near Wilmington which he named Masonboro Sound, but the people called it Mitchell's Sound. The husband of Mrs. Rudge contracted a violent cold, which brought on consumption, from which he died Dec. 30, 1860. MOVED TO SAVANNAH. Mrs. Rudge moved to Savannah in June 1871, where she has since resided. She has two children, Mrs. John Banks, wife of the carpenter of that name, with whom she resides, and one son, John William Rudge, living in Richmond, Va. She has a sister living in Savannah, Mrs. Eliza Hazelton, wife of Samuel J. Hazelton, the carpenter, on Montgomery street, who has three daughters. While Mrs. Rudge does not feel warranted in affirming that she is the person advertised for, she is free to say that there may be property coming from both sides of the family tree, the Rudges and the Mitchells. She intends communicating at an early date with the London and New York lawyers whose names are given in the advertisement, and is prepared by the best documentary evidence to establish her connection by blood and legal marriage with the Rudges and Mitchells of England. Mrs. Rudge is an intelligent lady, of pleasing address, refined by education and travel, and her friends in this city, who are many, sincerely hope that she will come into a rich legacy. It is understood that the amount awaiting the right Mrs. Rudge is in the neighborhood of $100,000." </cite>(30 Mar 1899 Morning News (Savannah, GA) p. 9)
<p>
COMMENTARY ON CONNECTION TO CHARLES DICKENS: <i>There is a rather obvious problem with the claim our ancestor William Rudge (1778-1823) was a neighbor of Charles Dickens (1812-1870), namely our ancestor died when the latter was only a boy and long before Louisa had even met her future husband. But there might be a grain of truth to it. William and Hannah had two daughters baptized in the Parish of St. Mary's, Portsea Hampshire England, before (9 Dec 1810) and after (22 Jan 1813) Charles Dickens was baptized (4 Mar 1812) at the same church. So it is possible William and Hannah lived across the street from Charles Dicken's father, John Dickens. I conjecture Louisa picked up the story from her mother in law, Hannah nee Taylor Rudge Adams, and that she learned of it sometime after Feb - Nov 1841 when Dickens' novel </i>Barnaby Rudge<i> was first published in a series of installments appearing in a magazine entitled </i>Master Humphrey's Clock<i>. I imagine the publication of the latter served to remind Hannah that they used to live across the way from Dickens' father. Biographies of Charles Dickens emphasize how the memories of his early childhood served as inspiration for his writings. I suspect "Rudge" was a simple, memorable name that he picked up on as a child. Beyond this, I don't see any basis for thinking any of the characters in the novel stem from any association the Dickens family had with ours. </i>

Edward appears in the 1851 UK census entry for John and Mary Crouch. He is identified as their nephew, unmarried, age 22, a boiler maker, and having been born in St. George in the East, Middlesex, England. (Crouch is one of his younger sister's given names. This suggests Mary's maiden name was Blindell. Interestingly, John and Mary's daughter in this entry (Hannah, age 11) is identified as having been born in France.)
<p>
Edward Rudge married <strong>Elizabeth Ann Frances nee HAWKINS RUDGE</strong>, widow of his brother Thomas William Rudge, at St. Paul's, Chatham, Kent, on 18 Oct 1857. She was born on 7 Aug 1825 in Limehouse, London and died Oct 1865 in Sheppley, Kent Co. England. (In the marriage record she is referred to as having the last name Read and identified as a widow. A notice from a law journal article confirms that indeed she is one and the same person who married his brother Thomas William.)
<p>
LAW ARTICLE MENTIONING HIM: <cite>"MARRYING A DECEASED HUSBAND'S BROTHER. -At the Sheerness Police Court, on March 2, Edward Rudge, boiler-maker, was summoned for the sum of 1 L. 4 s., being six weeks' arrears of contributions towards the maintenance of his son, aged twenty-eight, who is an inmate of Chatham Lunatic Asylum. -Evidence was given to show that, from 1883, when ordered to pay 4s. weekly was made, the payments were kept up regularly until Christmas last, when defendant refused to pay, alleging that the marriage was illegal. -The defendant stated that in October, 1857, he married, at St. Paul's Church, Chatham, Elizabeth Ann Frances Hawkings Rudge, who had been previously married (in 1847) to his elder brother Thomas, who was supposed to have died abroad a few years after his marriage. -Mr. Athawes, stipendary magistrate, said as the marriage came within the prohibited degree of affinity he had no alternative but to give the defendant the relief he sought for. He did so, however, with regret." </cite> (The Law Journal v. 21, page 147 (6 Mar 1886)) A later article (Saturday 6th March 1886, 'The Salisbury Times, etc' Wiltshire, England.) alleges she intentionally used the name Reed as her maiden name during the second marriage to prevent the clergyman from asking questions about the relationship.

John William migrated to this country with his mother and sister ca. 1857-59, and appears in the 1860 census entry noted for his parents above.

The actual story is more complicated. He began his military career in January of 1863 at Camp Maloney, Adams Run, Charleston Co. SC as a private in Company K of the 16th Regiment  of the South Carolina Infantry. According to <a href="musterrolls.html">muster rolls</a> he served for about a year as a "musician" and a "drummer." His muster roll card for Jan-Feb 1863 identifies him as being stationed at Adams Run; his muster roll cards for Mar-Apr and May-Jun 1863 identify him as being on detached duty, which suggests but does not imply he saw action with his unit. The unit was ordered to Wilmington in March of 1863 and served in that time before returning to Adams Run; the unit then left by rail on 4 May of 1863 from Charleston, SC to Jackson, MS, near Vicksburg. The unit was transferred to the command of General Statesrights Gist's brigade on 4 Jul 1863 after the fall of Vicksburg and transferred to Rome, GA. His muster roll card for Jul-Aug 1863 identifies him as a "Drummer -Extra on Daily duty - Transferred to the Band, Aug 31/63." Field and Staff muster roll cards for Sep-Oct and Nov-Dec 1863 identify him as a "musician". His Field and Staff muster roll card for Jan-Feb refers to him as "Deserted January 1, 1864 and gone to Bermuda." This latter entry is particularly intriguing as Bermuda was a major site of blockade runner traffic.
<p>
It is curious to note that neither his nor his son's obituaries (below) mention this infantry service, focusing instead on his later more exciting service as a cabin boy aboard a blockade runner that operated out of Fort Fisher in Wilmington. His daughter's application for membership in the United Daughters of the Confederacy states further that he was captured in Havana and subsequently placed in a New York City prison:
<p>
<cite>"My father has been dead several years and I do not remember his company or regiment. (My application blank was never returned.) I know he saw service about a year or two as he was born in 1849 and was too young to go to war. My grandmother was living in Columbia S.C. at the time and my father ran away from home and joined the army. He was taken in and served as drummer boy. He afterwards ran the blockade, was captured and taken to Havanna. from there he was taken to New York City and was there when Lee surrendered. I joined the U.D.C. when our chapter was organized. Mrs. J. D. Rast was Chapter Pres. and Mrs. H. H. London was State Pres."</cite> (Transcript of Katherine Erma nee Rudge Griffith's application to become a member of the United Daughters of the Confederacy - 21 Oct 1923). In a separate note to a cousin she further indicates that as a drummer boy he was present at the Battle of Lookout Mountain, and that he ran the blockade between Wilmington and Nassau. (undated set of notes by Kate nee Rudge Griffith returned to her in a letter from Lelia nee Houston Brett Owen-Wilson dated 28 Nov 1949).
<p>
A ship manifest provides evidence that he was on board the ship "Morro Castle" when it traveled on 4 May 1865 from Havana, Cuba to New York City. John Rudge is listed as a student and 14 years old. (Passenger and Crew Lists Arriving at New York, New York, National Archives, Microfilm roll M237_251; Line 36, list no. 315.) The Civil War ended with Lee's surrender on 9 Apr 1865, and as such it is possible his imprisonment actually took place in Cuba.
<p>
I've been unable to find any other records that provide any further information on his imprisonment. Here's a <A HREF="jwr.html">photograph</a> taken of him during his confederate service. Here are some photographs of a <a href="b8.html">dagger</a> he owned during his service. The <a href="http://webspace.webring.com/people/lu/um_8729/rudgejw.html#">story</a> of John William's confederate service has been featured on a site devoted to the <a href="http://webspace.webring.com/people/lu/um_8729/franklin7k.html#">history of the SC 16th infantry</a> developed and maintained by Steven Baston.

After the Civil War, John William returned to Wilmington, New Hanover Co. NC where he became a tinner for a firm called A.W. Lawson & Co. and resided with his mother.

John is listed by name on a petition of a part of a group not larger than 40 requesting to form the "Wilmington Hook and Ladder Company" that was presented to the state legislature on 26 Feb 1867 (Entry appearing in a chapter of a book entitled "Chapter CVII. An Act to Incorporate the Wilmington Hook and Ladder Company" in <i>Public Laws of the State of North Carolina Passed by the General Assembly at the Sessions of 1866-'67</i>, pp. 370-372.).
<p>
As mentioned in connection with his mother above, John William became a member of the Grace Methodist Episcopal Church (aka Front Street Station M.E. Church South) on 18 Aug 1869. He is included on a list of church members dated 1870, and apparently remained a member after his mother and sister left in Feb 1873, as he wasn't removed at that time. His name is included on a list dated 1880 where he is referred to as having been "removed by certificate"- no specific date given. [There is no reference to his wife (below) becoming a member of this church.] 
<p>
The 1870 census for Wilmington taken in July includes John William in an entry for Lucy Tilley's boarding house.  Mrs. Tilley is listed as a widow with two daughters, Lina and Melvina. John William is identified as "Tinner," age 22 yrs old, and born in NC. Next to him is Thomas Tolar, "Tinner," age 24, born in VA. Also appearing are two railroad engineers from NC, "James Exum" (38 yrs. old)  and "Harry Blackman" (48  yrs. old). A black "houseservant, Richard Gibbs (16 yrs  old) is also included, who is identified as not able to read or write.
<p>
John William married <strong>Caroline Virginia PAE</strong>, daughter of Archibald PAE & Sophia BATH, on 11 Oct 1870 in Wilmington, New Hanover Co. NC. She was born on 4 Mar 1844 in Richmond, Henrico Co. VA. She died of angina pectoris on 19 Jul 1922 in Monroe, Union Co. NC and was buried on 20 Jul 1922 in the Monroe City Suncrest Cemetery, Monroe, Union Co. NC. One of the censuses lists her occupation as "Milliner" (ladies hat maker). She was also a member First Presbyterian Church, Monroe Union Co. NC. Information about her ancestry is located <a href="pae.html">here</a>. Here's a collection of 10 <A HREF="cvpaerudgealbum.html">photographs of Caroline Virginia nee Pae Rudge</a> that span her lifetime, including one that appears to have been taken on the day of their marriage.

John William Rudge opened an account at the Freedman Bank on 3 Jun 1873. The record identifies him as a "tin smith" and includes the initials of his immediate family, also mentioning that his father is dead. (<i>Freedman Bank Records, Account no. 6992; Film no. 4098525, images 725.</i>)

<p>
John William and his family (including his mother, Louisa nee MITCHELL RUDGE) moved to Monroe, Union Co. NC ca. Apr 1874 or 1875 according to their respective obituaries. Ads for his tin store, called "The Big Coffee Pot", first appear in August of 1875.
<p>
AD FOR HIS STORE: <em>"The Big Coffee Pot. HAVING OPENED A NEW TIN SHOP over Jno. D. Stewart's store, I announce to the public that I am prepared to furnish any and all kinds of TIN WARE, either Wholesale or Retail, cheap for cash. Roofing, Guttering, and in fact anything in the TIN LINE done as well and as cheaply as can be had in this market. I claim that merchants in this section will save at least freights from buying from me, and I further guarantee the quality of the ware to be equal to any and better than that generally sold North. Look for the BIG COFFEE POT, over Stewart's Dry Goods Store. J.W. RUDGE Aug. 30, 1875 14-tl."</em> (31 Aug 1875 Monroe Enquirer p. 3)
<p>
The Monroe Enquirer features several ads for his tin shop that indicate he specialized in selling tin stoves and worked during the summer installing or repairing roofs and gutters. 
<p>
"J. W. Rudge of the town of Monroe" is identified as the recipient of a mortgage deed against $22 owed to him by E.P. Chaney that was signed on 3 Oct 1876 (Union County NC Deed Record Book 8, p. 341). Union County has records of several additional land transactions involving John William and his wife between 1880 and 1922, most of which are conducted in his wife's name.
<p>
John William and Caroline Virginia lived on 203-205 North Crawford St., ca. 1880-1900. The house was built in 1880 and sold to Dr. Stephen J. Welsh in 1901 . Dr. Welsh is said to have added 12 rooms to the original three, creating the present two-story, Classical Revival Style frame residence. According to a tradition related to me by Katherine Niven, the three children born in Monroe were all born in this house. Our information about the house contradicts this, since only Archie was born after 1880. It may be that the 1880 structure replaced a house which previously existed on the same lot. After selling the house, they moved to Washington St.
<p>
John continued to work as a tinner to support his family while they lived in Monroe. An ad appearing in a local paper gives some details of the sort of work he did:
<p>
<cite>"Practical Tinner. Forty Years at the Business. I am prepared to do all kinds of Roofing, Guttering, Ridge Moulding, all kinds of Ornaments for churches and houses. I do all kinds of shop and repair work and guarantee first class work. Shop on Washington Street. 'Phone 209. John  W. Rudge"</cite> (The Monroe Journal 20 Sep 1910 p. 8; 27 Sep 1910 p. 7; 4 Oct 1910 p. 4; 11 Oct 1910 p. 2.)
<p>
Annual reports for the City of Monroe published in the Monroe Journal mention John William did repair work for the city on an occasional basis as well (e.g. <cite>"Annual Statement... Nov 1909 J. W. Rudge, repairing $9.50"</cite> (17 May 1910 The Monroe Journal p. 3). 
<p>
Caroline Virginia had her own millinery business- several ads for her hat shop also appear in local newspapers from 1877-1890. Here's an ad for her store:
<p>
<cite>"To The Ladies AND FORMER CUSTOMERS Mrs. Carrie V. Rudge wishes to inform them that she has again resumed the millinery business and has just received a full supply of new goods. If you want to see something pretty, and of the latest style, just give me a call. I have some of the finest and as cheap goods as was ever on this market. For Beaver and Felt Hats.

John William was a fellow in the Masonic Lodge at Monroe, Union Co. NC. We have a large <a href="plaque.html">plaque</a>, given to us by Steve Kenney, which includes a photograph of him. The plaque reads as follows- <cite>"November 29, 1887. Masonic Record and Emblematic John W. Rudge History of Fortitude, Temperance, Prudence and Justice.

<p>
The 1880 census for Monroe taken on 3 Jun 1880 includes an entry for John William, his wife, mother-in-law  and three children along with a black servant, Robert Blair (35 yrs old, from NC). Blair was a former slave and a cook for the first Monroe Light Infantry Company [aka Company D] of the NC State Guard, which John William was affiliated with as a drummer from 1882-1897. A newspaper account of this company is located <a href="sg.html">here</a>.
<p>
It is unclear where John William (and his family) lived during the period between 1880 and 1905. There are several references to his ongoing involvement in a number of activities associated with Monroe, such as his membership with the Masons, the State Guard, a local church and the 1900 census noted below. Yet there are several Savannah, GA city directories (1889, 1893, 1895, 1900, and 1904) that contain entries for either John or John W. Rudge, a tinner or foreman that most certainly refer to him. Several of the newspaper ads I've found for his tinner's shop announce his return to business in Monroe. Several records of land transactions in Union County also suggest he was absent at the time of sale. A write-up of his daughter Katherine Erma Rudge's wedding (29 Jun 1904) strongly suggests he wasn't present. The most logical explanation is that while his residence was in Monroe, he maintained an apartment in Savannah, perhaps on a seasonal basis, to acquire more work. The ad for his wife's business above, directed to her <em>former</em> customers, suggests the family may have accompanied him to Savannah on at least one occasion.

In the 1900 census for Monroe, NC John William and his family are included as an entry. John William is listed as 51 years old, born January 1849 in France, a tinner, married 29 years and living at Washington Street. The house is indicated as mortgaged. His wife is listed as 50 years old and born March 1850 in VA. His son William John and daughter Katherine Erma are also included in this entry. [There is no entry for John William (or his mother) in the soundex to the 1900 census for Savannah, GA.]

Among his various other attributes, John William RUDGE was also an inventor. I have obtained a copy of the letters patent for a combination fertilizer and cotton seeder from the U.S. Patent Office (patent no. 806, 005, applied for on 7 Aug 1905 and awarded 28 Nov 1905). A brief write up of the invention in a local paper describes it as follows:
<p>
<cite>"A Valuable Invention. Mr. J. W. Rudge of this place has invented a combination cotton planter and guano distributor that is destined to be a great success. The planter opens the trench, drops in the guano, puts a small quantity of dirt upon it, then covers and packs them. All the planters at present in use put in only the seed after the ground has been previously prepared and the guano put in. It will be seen at once that Mr. Rudge's invention saves a great deal of labor and will be a valuable instrument to the cotton farmer. It will be about the size of an ordinary planter. Mr. Rudge has been working upon his idea for several years, and succeeded in getting his model in shape this springand used it in actual cotton planting, the seed which he planted coming up beautifully. A patent has been applied for and will no doubt be secured at once, as the patent attorneys at Washington say that the records of the government office show no invention of a like character. Mr. Rudge expects to organize a company and manufacture his machines here."</cite> (The Monroe Journal, 23 Jun 1903, p. 3)
<p>
According to subsequent newspaper articles, John William and his son William John RUDGE formed a company to manufacture and market the invention by 15 Aug 1905. Here's a copy of the <a href="patent.html">patent</a>. Ads for the invention appear in successive issues of the paper appearing on 12 and 19 Apr 1910:
<p>
<cite>"NEW COTTON PLANTER - I want to plant your cotton to demonstrate the value of our 'Combined Fertilizer Distributor and Cotton Seed Planter.' It puts in the guano and covers it up, and then the seed and covers them up, all in one operation, and can be regulated to put the fertilizer and seed to any desired depth. The most economical machine for planting ever invented. See them at work. John W. Rudge"</cite> (The Monroe Journal 12 Apr 1910, p. 5; 19 Apr 1910 p. 5)
<p>
<cite>"HENRY BELK. Of Fish and Fishing.... Most folks of middle age today never know the well as the only water supply for the home. I recall the late Sam [sic] Rudge of Monroe. He was a tinner of imagination. He invented a gadget to empty a bucket of water at the well without having to pick up the bucket and hold it and pour the water out. His device consisted of a prong about three inches high mounted in the center of a tin boxlike contraption that was mounted on the well curb. Rudge's invention included a well bucket with a hinged stopper about the size of a dollar. The pressure of the water as it came up out of the well would keep this stopper closed. One swung the bucket and let it down on the tin box in such a fashion that the spring pushed up the stopper and let the water run out. Arranged with a spout at one end, the box was fixed so that the spout was level with the edge of the bucket to be filled. This stood on a shelf on the curb at the right height. It worked. It saved the back and arm-breaking toil of lifting and emptying heavy buckets. Rudge might have made a fortune out of his invention but the world changed and he didn't invent anything to go along with the change.

The funeral will be held tomorrow at 11 o'clock at the residence of Mr. J. T. Griffith, with the burial ceremony of the Masonic Order.  Mr. Rudge lost his health some years ago, and finally was taken to the hospital two years ago in the hopes that he could be benefited. But this hope proved vain. He was sixty-six years old. He was born in France, though of English descent, and came to this country at the age of ten years. He was one of the youngest boys in the service of the Confederate government, and was employed during the war as a cabin boy on Confederate blockade runners plying in and out of the port of Wilmington. His recollections of the dangers and hardships of this service was very vivid. Soon after his marriage he came to Monroe, where the family has resided since. Mr. and Mrs. Rudge came to Monroe 41 years ago last April. Mr. Rudge engaged in the tin business and was a very superior workman and contractor and did the pioneering work of that kind in all this section. He was a quiet man who attended to his affairs with zeal. He was a member of the Presbyterian Church. His wife and three children survive him. They are Mr. W. J. Rudge, Mrs. J. B. Coble and Mrs. J. T. Griffith, all of Monroe. Mr. Rudge is one of the very last of the older citizens of Monroe."</cite> (3 Dec 1915 The Monroe Journal p. 5)

The bride is a lady of most charming graces and noble Christian character. She is one of the most popular young ladies of Monroe and it is not a mere matter of form that we say that she is a woman worthy of the love of a husband who is so fortunate as to win her hand and heart. After the marriage Mr. and Mrs. Coble left for points in Georgia and Florida. They will be away about three weeks when they return and make Monroe their home. With their many other friends here we wish for Mr. and Mrs. Coble every joy that is ever vouchsafed to mortals and that their married life may reach as nearly to the perfection of happiness as it is possible."</cite>

In <strong>Sketches of Monroe and Union County</strong> by Stack and Beasley (1902) the William Rudge Co. store is described as follows-- <cite>"The accompanying picture shows the pretty interior of the book, stationary, fancy goods and jewelry store of the W. J. Rudge Company, and a visit to this store will verify the impression made by the picture that this is one of the prettiest stores o its kind to be found in North Carolina. Not only is it pretty, but it is likewise commodious, having a floor space of 31X90 feet. That handsome building was recently erected by Belk Bros. and was constructed especially for this firm. The interior is finely finished, which, with the many large floor show cases, and other up-to-date furnishings, accounts for the fine effect upon a visitor when he enters the door. The company is incorporated and has the following officers--R. A. Morrow, president; Dr. J. M. Belk, vice president; W. J. Rudge, secretary and treasurer and general manager. Papers of incorporation were granted in October 1900, and the company has since been doing a thriving business. Mr. Rudge, the manager, is assisted by his sister, Kate Rudge, both of whom are exceedingly popular. Mr. Rudge is yet a very young man, and a bright future lies before him. The company has a large trade in school books, books of a general nature, magazines, jewelry and fancy goods."</cite> Eventually his wife's brother, Dr. W. C. Houston, bought him out.

C. English, W. R. Kirkman, Dr. J. W. Ormand, L. S. Sloop and G. H. Clontz.  Mr. Rudge was born in Monroe in July, 1876. His parents had come here from Wilmington the previous year before when the railroad came. Monroe was expected to soon be a big town and it did go into a boom. Mr. Rudge's father, the late John W. Rudge, was a tinner and contractor and put the roofs on all the early buildings erected here. As a youth he had a considerable career.  His parents were English people who moved to France, where he was born. When he was eight years old his parents came to Wilmington and settled. At fourteen he ran away from home and got into the Confederate service. When the Confederacy was on its last legs, its ebbing commercial life blood was kept flowing through the Federal blockade at Wilmington. Blockade runners passed in and out under the guns of Fort Fisher, dodged through and around the Federal fleet at night. The cotton that they carried out and the goods they brought in from Nassau, Cuba and other ports, kept North Carolinian troops supplied after every other port of the Confederacy had fallen. Mr. Rudge was a cabin boy in the blockade fleet and ran under the gun many times, going and coming between Wilmington and Nassau.  Mrs. Rudge, the mother of Mr. W. J. Rudge, was a Virginian, born and reared in Richmond.  Mr. Rudge was educated in the Monroe schools and in Washington City. He came back from Washington and began in the store of Belk Bros. Almost accidentally he got into the business which he followed in after life. Rev. A. T. Latta, who had run a book store in Monroe for many years, wished to sell out on account of his age. The Belks, Mr. R. A. Morrow, and Mr. Rudge bought the store and greatly enlarged it, and Mr. Rudge managed it the remainder of his life, having bought out his partners many years before. Mr. Rudge was an elder in the Presbyterian church, a Mason, and a man who had a large circle of warm friends. He was of a keen mind, affable, kind and accommodating. His long years in the book and jewelry business had made him known to a great many people who will learn of his death with regret.  Mr. Rudge is survived by Mrs. Rudge, who was Miss Josephine Adams, daughter of the late Mr. and Mrs. H. B. Adams, and by one son and one daughter. The son is Mr. William J. Rudge J. of Pittsfield, Mass., and the daughter is Mrs. Steve Kenney of Tarboro. Two sisters survive, Mrs. Carrie Coble and Mrs. Jas. T. Griffith, of Monroe."</cite>(26 Nov 1940 Monroe Journal p. 1, 5)

FIRST MARRIAGE NOTICE: <cite>"One of the prettiest weddings that Monroe has had for a long while was that of Mr. Jas. T.

Large number of People Witness the Rudge-Griffith Ceremony in the Presbyterian Church. Monroe, June, 29. A large crowd which occupied nearly every available foot of space in the Presbyterian church this evening at 8 o'clock and overflowed into the Sunday school room, vestible and steps was present to witness the marriage of Miss Rudge, the attractive daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John W. Rudge, to Mr. James T. Griffith. The church was beautifully decorated for the occasion. Festoons of hydrangea, palms, ferns and various other potted plants were gracefully draped over the pulpit. Rev. George H. Atkinson, the pastor of the bride, spoke the words that sealed their plighted troth. The ushers were the first of the bridal party to enter, Messrs. E.C. Winchester and James A. Stewart. Next were the bridesmaids and groomsmen to enter as follows: Miss Alice Scales with Mr. J.C. Sikes Jr., parting at the door and crossing over on the other side from the entrance at the altar, followed in the same manner by the other attendants-Miss May Blakeney with Mr. Ed. Crow; Miss Faye Gaddy with Mr. Eugene Ashcraft; Miss Ola Bruner with Mr. E. J. Heath. Next after the bridesmaids and groomsmen came the maid of honor, Miss Patti Adams, who wore a pink silk mull, down the middle aisle, then Mr. Griffith with his best man, Mr. T. J. Payne. Then followed the bride, who entered with her brother, Mr. W. J. Rudge. She was never more beautiful than in her simple gown of tailored suit of brown voll over brown taffeta silk with hat to match, carrying bride's roses. The bridesmaids wore white mull, carrying pink carnations. The bridal party entered the church to the music of Mendelssohn's march and retiring by Lohengrin's. Mrs. H.R. Laney was at the organ. A more beautiful marriage has never been witnessed in this city in years. The presents were various and numerous, and handsome to a degree, wealth of cut glass, silver and many other presents will be received from other places.

STORIES TO REMEMBER THEM BY:<i> "The Cobles had a tradition of tea every afternoon at 4:00 p.m. in the dining room. We went over every Sunday afternoon and took Mama Coble (Carrie Rudge Coble) for a drive if she was well enough and then back for tea. Aunt Kate always came with a big bear hug for everybody. She was tall and slim and pretty. She was taller than her husband or sister. She always drove a big black Roadmaster Buick (they got a new one every year.) Uncle Jim never drove. In fact, when he left on Monday for his work week he had a driver (a black man named Hazel)."</i>(letter from Brenda Coble Robinson to David Rudge 18 June 2005)

<p>
TESTIMONIALS: <cite>"The latest of these was J.T. Griffith. Mr. Jim was a gentleman in every sense of the word. Quiet and unassuming, he went about his daily tasks and pleasures in a serene manner. He was a gentleman fisherman, which to those of the faith, is about the highest compliment that can be paid. With a keen business sense he did not fall short of worldy goods but something of the small boy remained with him during his mature life for he enjoyed no pleasure more than reading a Western story or seeing a Western movie. Mr. Jim was fond of playing setback, and while he had his own companions at the game, he was not averse to playing with younger people. I happened to fall into tht category and some of the most interesting games I played with Mr. Jim. Of his setback 'cronies' all have gone on, except possibly one, Walter Sanders, who is still strong in going to the church, business and in the fishing ponds. No doubt the spirit of Mr. Jim was welcomed by such former companions as Will Rudge, George Beasley, Cap Clontz, D. B. Snyder, Fred Huntley, Nee English, and others."</cite>  (7 Jun 1955 Monroe Journal); <cite> "ANOTHER BLOW. THE GRIM Reaper has been singling out old friends in grievous numbers in recent days. This issue chronicles the departure of James T. Griffith, a gentleman long admired by this department. "Mr. Jim" was a special friend of my father and a favorite partner in those hard-fought set-back games they used to play. Mr. Jim and Mr. George were serious players and held their cards close to the chest. Walter Sanders and the late W. J. Rudge were their strongest adversaries until the latter's death. Messrs. Sanders and Rudge were exponents of the wide-open game and were not averse to distracting their opponents with talk and trickery. Some fierce battles ensued but never severe enough to disturb one of the strongest 4-way bonds of friendship I ever saw."</cite>; <cite> "'IN THE FATHER'S HOUSE' The Session of the First Presbyterian Church of Monroe records with deep grief its heavy and irreplacable [sic] loss when one of its most beloved and valued members, James T. Griffith, went to live in the Father's House. Nowhere outside the home where they loved him best and will miss him most, will this loss be  felt more keenly than in the Session where he served with distinction for over a quarter of a century. Mr. Griffith graced his home and church and community with a charming and winsome and beautiful Christian life. We saw in his manly but gentle spirit the marks of a Christian. He placed service above self in his business and in his church. He served his church well as superintendent of the Sunday School for many years where he profoundly influenced the lives of the young. He, like his Master, was always to be found in the Home of the Lord on the Sabbath Day. His strength of character, his gentle spirit, his sympathetic disposition, his quiet  and unassuming manner, and his beautiful Christian attitude made him one of God's noblemen. We are grateful for this Child of the King who walked among us like the fragrance of some rich and rare perfume. We are proud of his complete loyalty and utter devotion to his church. In life he was ours and in death we still proudly claim him as our own. It is ordered by the Session that a copy of this memorial be sent to the family, a copy sent to the local papers, and a copy be written permanently into the Sessional records. - Committee: Roy F. Whitley, Moderator; W. Harvey Morrison, Clerk."</cite>

HOW HE MET HIS WIFE: <cite>"My father was on assignment in the GE test program in Pittsfield, MA in the power business and he studied lightening. And one of the assignments that  they gave him was to go out to Croton Dam in Michigan to take pictures and study lightening at a power facility. Well my mother's father was the superintendent of that dam, Alfred Wyss. (At the time there was no hotel in Croton Dam and Alfred Wyss used to entertain visitors to the dam, so anyone who visited the dam was put up in Alfred Wyss' house)  And so when Dad was there doing his electrical research he obviously met the sisters, including my mother who was back at home during the summer from college.  They drove back to Pittsfield and got married there, where William Jerome Rudge, jr. was staying at Mrs. Richie's boarding house while employed by General Electric there."</cite> (Recollection of his son, William Jerome Rudge III).

FIRST MARRIAGE NOTICE -<cite> "IN WOMAN'S REALM. Kenney-Rudge. In a ceremony marked by beauty and simplicity, Miss Fannie Person Rudge was married, on Saturday at high noon to Mr. Stephen Estridge [sic]  Winston Kenney, of Windsor. The ceremony took place at the home of the bride's parents, Mr. and Mrs. W. J. Rudge's on Washington street, only the immediate families and a few close friends of the young couple being present. Rev. H.E. Gurney, D.D., a former pastor of the bride, officiated, reading the impressive Episcopal seremony [sic] from a prayer book which is an heirloom in the Gurney family. There was a charming disposal of cut flowers and potted plants throughout the lower floor of the Rudge home, and the vows were spoken before an improvised altar of palms and ferns artistically arranged in the living room. The bride entered with her father, Mr. W.J. Rudge, who gave her in marriage; and from the opposite door the groom entered with his best man, Mr. Harry Wood Coble. The bride was lovely in a gown of rough-patterned Venetian blue crepe with beige trimmings and accessories and becoming spring hat developed in beige tones. Following the marriage ceremony a buffet luncheon was served in the dining room, where the table was laid with an exquisite filet cloth and centered with a silver basket of pink and white carnations. Tall pink candles in silver holders, each tied with a butterfly bow of tulle, further carried out the color motif of pink and white. The bride is the only daughter of Mr. and Mrs. W. J. Rudge. She is a pretty, blonde, intellectual and talented, and possesses a charm of personality which endears her to many friends. She was educated at Salem College and is a gifted musician. The groom is the nephew and adopted son of Judge Francis D. Winston, of Windsor. Judge Winston and the bride's grandfather, the late Mr. H.B. Adams, were friends during the lifetime of the latter having met often both in the practice of law and during the sessions of the State legislature. Miss Rudge and Mr. Kenney first met at summer school at the University of North Carolina, where they formed the acquaintance which culminated in their romance and the marriage of Saturday noon. Mr. Kenney is a graduate of State University and he also received a degree in law at that institution. He is now a member of the law firm of Matthews, Winston and Kenney at Windsor. The bride and groom left after the ceremony for a wedding trip, after which they will make their home  in Windsor. On Friday evening, Mr. and Mrs. James T. Griffith gave a dinner party in honor of Judge Francis D. Winston and Mrs. Winston, who were their house guests, having come especially to attend the marriage of their nephew, Mr. Stephen Kenney to Miss Fannie Person Rudge, niece of Mrs. Griffith. The centerpiece was a lovely flowering of cyclamen, and a four-course dinner was served. The guests were Judge Winston and Mrs. Winston, Miss Fannie Person Rudge, Mr. Stephen Kenney, Mr. and Mrs. Harry Wood Coble, and Miss Caroline Coble." </cite>(The Monroe Journal ?)

OBITUARY:<em>"CLINTON - Mr. William Jerome Rudge, III, 89, passed quietly on 21 May 2020, surrounded by his family at Brookdale Independent Living. William (Bill) was the son of William Jerome Rudge, Jr. and Lena Anne Wyss and spent his childhood in Lenox, MA, where he attended Lenox High School and Lenox School for Boys. He earned an A.B. Degree at Duke University in 1954, majoring in psychology and later took several graduate courses. He served as a corporal in the army from 1954-56 and was briefly stationed in Germany before he was honorably discharged. In 1957, he began work for the General Electric Company as a specialist in technical training programs and as part of his training rotation worked briefly at the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory, where he met his future wife, Beverly Anne Cook, who worked there as a secretary. They were married on 6 Dec 1958 and eventually settled in Clinton, NY, where they raised four children. Mr. Rudge retired in 1991, at which time he devoted himself full-time to a variety of volunteer activities for the American Boy Scouts, American Red Cross, Kiwanis, the Mohawk Valley Engineering Council, the Clinton Historical Society and the Clinton United Methodist Church. Mr. Rudge's extensive participation in these organizations earned him several distinguished honors, including the Silver Beaver Award by the American Boy Scouts in 1975, the highest award the American Boy Scout Council can bestow on a volunteer. He donated almost 20 gallons of blood and aided extensively in the organization of several blood drives for the American Red Cross. He served as president of the Clinton Kiwanis Club. He organized numerous career fairs for future engineering students. He served as a lay speaker for the United Methodist Church. He also served as Village Trustee from 1976-78. Mr. Rudge's extensive service to his community was honored in 1992 when the mayor of Clinton proclaimed June 11 as "Bill Rudge Day." Mr. Rudge and his wife maintained a cottage on Laurel Lake, Lenox and engaged in local community work there as well. During their retirement, they travelled extensively. More recently, they celebrated their sixtieth wedding anniversary shortly after arriving at Brookdale. On 7 Mar 2019, Bill was awarded the first Clinton Chamber of Commerce Volunteer of the Year award for his many decades of community service. In September of 2019, Bill and Bev were recognized for their 50 years of dedication to the Kirkland Blood Drives. Surviving are his wife, Beverly; four children, William J. Rudge, IV (wife, Patricia), Mrs. Laura Wolfe (husband, Dan), David Rudge (husband, Bob) and Mrs. Susan Corney (husband, Jim); six grandchildren, Caleb and Sarah Rudge, Stephanie and Eric Wolfe and Philip and Mindy Corney. Bill and his family greatly appreciate the help and support of numerous local medical community doctors and staff and also the friendship and support of his many neighbors, friends and fellow parishioners at Clinton United Methodist Church, who have been so helpful during the last six months. Many thanks to Sharon Meyer and the staff at Brookdale for their tremendous care and compassion. The funeral will be held at a later date and will be announced by Owens-Pavlot & Rogers Funeral Service, Clinton. In lieu of flowers, Bill asked that you consider donating a pint of blood (to save 2 ? lives) or donating to Rise Against Hunger of the Clinton United Methodist Church, the American Red Cross, the Leatherstocking Council, Boy Scouts of America or your local food pantry."</em> (Published in The Observer-Dispatch from May 23 to May 24, 2020.
