WI.<ul><li><a href="finderi.html">Index</a> to this page.</ul><center><h3>Descendants of Johann Friedrich Finder of Arnswalde, Pomerania</h3></center><p><cite>"My daughter Constance and her husband were in Europe in October and enjoyed it very much. She went last year too. They rent a car for the duration of their stay and travel by themselves to places where some of the tourist groups do not go. She traveled to Billebache to find out about our great grandfather [Johann Friedrich Breitkreutz] but the town had no Protestants (all Catholics) so that wasn't us. The Burgermeister was very nice and said there were four other Billebaches, all little villages, so when she went this year she went to these villages. The people were very nice but so many of the church records were destroyed during the war so she was out of luck. Constance has a reason for thinking it was near Hanover. Anyway there goes our family tree. Our grandfather [Christian Friedrich Wilhelm Breitkreutz] had money inherited from his mother. He brought Uncle Hennigs, Uncle Blumberg and Mike Finders also our great grandmother Finder [Maria ? Finder] to America. He paid their expenses and a winter in Watertown before migrating to Lake Mills, north (of lake) end. The log cabin that the Stelses lived in was built by Grandpa B. Finders went on to Nebraska later on I understand. This about all I really know and it was told to me by our grandfather when he was living with us one year.

Clausen of Salinas CA as the submitter (LDS microfilm 1394270, Submission AF83-061768). The site indicates her address is out of date. The LDS IGI index provides some confirmation of the basic details she has sketched out. The note above, which identifies Johanna Caroline nee Finder Breitkreutz as having a relative named Michael and a mother named Maria accords with the information Ms. Clausen provides for her Michael Finder, also of Lake Mills. As such, I have tentatively concluded that he represents Johanna Caroline nee Finder Breitkreutz's brother.<p><hr><center><strong>First Generation</strong></center><p><hr><p><a name="one"><strong>1. Johann Friedrich<sup>1</sup> FINDER</strong>. He was born ca. 1806 in Arnswalde, Brndnb, Prussia. He married <strong>Maria GORKA</strong> ca. 1823. She was born ca. 1810 in Arnswalde, Brndnb, Prussia. <p>According to the Lake Mills Spike, 13 Oct 1879, there were four Finders listed as Electors of the First Election District of the Town of Lake Mills: "Chas., M., Fred, and Aug." I suspect "Chas." and "M." are references to two of their children, Karl and Michael. It is tempting to speculate that the other Finders listed are also related, although I note Fred Finder (in attendance at Johanna Caroline's wedding anniversary below) is not specifically identified as a relative.<p>Johann Friedrich FINDER and Maria GORKA had at least the following children:<pre>	<a href="#two">2</a>	i.	Johanna Caroline<sup>2</sup> FINDER (1823-1907)	<a href="#three">3</a>	ii.	Karl<sup>2</sup> FINDER	<a href="#four">4</a>	iii.

Johanna Caroline<sup>2</sup> FINDER</strong> (<a href="#one">Johann Friedrich</a><sup>1</sup>). She was born on 1 Feb 1823 in Augustwald, Pomerania, Germany. She died of multiple sarcoma on 24 Jul 1907 in Lake Mills, Jefferson Co. WI and was buried on 25 Jul 1907 in the Rock Lake Cemetery, Lake Mills, Jefferson Co. WI. She was a member of the Moravian Church, Lake Mills. <p>She married <strong>Christian Friedrich Wilhelm BREITKREUTZ</strong>, son of Johan Friedrich BREITKREUTZ & Regina KREKLOW, on 5 Jun 1848 in Augustwald, Pomerania, Germany.

Information about her husband's ancestry and her descendants is located <a href=" http://kanga.cc.wmich.edu/~rudged/gen/breit.html#three">here</a>.<p>Johanna Carolina and her family migrated from Germany using money from her  mother-in-law's estate on Sept 29, 1858. They is listed as arriving on 4 Jan 1859 through the port of NY, age 31, both parents are listed as born in Germany; With her husband are listed his wife(?) Jane (33) and children Henry(9), William (7) and Harman (2). Also listed is a Sophia Finder(62 yrs old). The ship is called the Aristedes and left from Bremerhaven.

Breitkreutz took place at their residence in this village on Sunday last at 2:30 p. m., attended by children, grandchildren and near friends. The relatives present were the three sons, Henry, William and Herman, and their families, and the only daughter, Mrs. G. Helpap and Mr. Helpap, a sister and Mr. Carl Finder, a brother of Mrs. Breitkreutz, and Mrs. Finder, Mr. and Mrs. August Henning, Mr. and Mrs. Carl Blumberg, Mr. and Mrs. Kuhl and daughter Elmira and sixteen grandchildren. Mr. Fred Finder and Mr. Ernest Wolf were also guests. Rev. Wm. Strohmeier delivered an appropriate and touching address, and Rev. Theo. Sonderman distributed the gifts, among which were a gold-headed ebony cane, a present to Mr. Breitkreutz, and an umbrella with gold-mounted hand piece and a pair of gold spectacles, a gift to Mrs. Breitkreutz. The celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the marriage of these elderly people was planned by their children, and at an appointed hour the party came upon Mr. and Mrs. Breitkreutz in the quiet of their home as unexpectedly as roses in the summertime, a perfect surprise, which, however, proved to be a most happy one, filling their hearts with gladness. At five o'clock p. m. supper was served and the happy guests vied with each other in filling the hour with as much joy as possible to those who had reached their fiftieth mile-stone in their journey of life together and were now permitted to look into the faces and hear the happy voices of so many of their children and grandchildren, while they themselves still enjoy a goodly measure of health and strength of body and mind. The hours were made happy by reminiscences of the fifty years passed until the hour of 9 p. m., when the guests took their departure, gladdened with the thought that they had been instrumental in adding to the joys of two honest devoted hearts."</cite> (Lake Mills Spike 9 Jun 1898).

Their married life was blessed with four children, three sons and one daughter, Mrs. G. A. Helpap, Wm. Jr., Henry and Herman Breitkreutz- all of whom survive their mother. The deceased had suffered over two years, passed through three surgical operations each giving temporary, but no permanent relief. Hers was a case of sarcoma from which she did not suffer very much pain until the last few weeks of her life. She was patient and uncomplaining, bearing her distresses with fortitude.
