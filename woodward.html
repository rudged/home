Here's a genealogy for one branch of the Woodward family that migrated from Gloucester, Essex Co., MA to York Co. ME. Beamsley Woodward's immediate ancestry is well documented in Ferris, Mary Walton (1943) <em>Dawes-Gates Ancestral Lines: A Memorial Volume Containing the American Ancestry of Rufus R. Dawes, v. 1</em>, a privately printed manuscript. Doris J. Woodward and Patricia Law Hatcher have written an essay entitled "The English Origin of Nathaniel Woodward: Early Settler of Boston, Massachusetts and Ancestor of Beamsley Woodward of Maine" that appears in the Nov 1998 issue (vol. 20, no. 4) of <em>The Maine Genealogist</em>. Nathaniel Woodward was Beamsley's great grandfather. Questions concerning Beamsley's ancestry and descendants may be directed to Doris Woodward at woodwarddj@omnicast.net. My work on this family has focused on Beamsley's son <a href="#eight">William</a> and his descendants.

<p>
<hr>
<center><strong>First Generation</strong></center><p>
<hr>
<p>
<a name="one"><strong>1. Beamsley WOODWARD</strong>. He was born the son of Ezekiel WOODWARD and Hannah PERKINS on 4 Nov 1711 in Gloucester, Essex Co. MA. He died sometime before 1790. He was a glazier.
<p>
On 20 Feb 1733/1734 Beamsley married <strong>Sarah SMITH</strong>, daughter of William SMITH & Sarah GOWEN, in Gloucester, Essex Co. MA. She was born on 12 Mar 1710 in Kittery, York Co. ME. She died in Waterborough, York Co. ME sometime before 1800.
<p>
RECORD OF THEIR BIRTHS: A record of his birth appears in Bragdon, L. (1921) "Births of the Upper Parish In York" p. 41: "Beamsley Woodward born March 11, 1710. Mary his wife born the day following March 12, 1710."; There is also a record of birth his in Vital Records of Gloucester, MA, Births, p. 784 "WOODARD, Beamsly, s. Ezekiell and Hannah, Nov. 4, 1711." The second date may represent the day he was christened.
<p>
RECORD OF MARRIAGE: "WOODWARD, Beamsley, and Sarah Smith, Feb. 20, 1733-4." Vital Records of Gloucester, MA, Marriages, p. 395. [Intentions also recorded]
<p>
"Sarah Woodward, widow" appears in the 1790 census for Waterborough, York County, ME (p. 69). In addition to herself she is listed as living with one additional free white female, (if it was her son William's oldest daughter Anna it would explain the discrepancy noted regarding his entry below).
<p>
Beamsley WOODWARD and Sarah SMITH had the following children, most of whose births and baptisms are recorded in <em>Vital Records of Gloucester, MA, Births,</em> p. 792:
<pre>	<a href="#two">2</a>	i.	Lemuel WOODWARD (1734-1810)
	<a href="#three">3</a>	ii.	Sarah WOODWARD (1736-)
	<a href="#four">4</a>	iii.	Beamsley WOODWARD (1738-)
	<a href="#five">5</a>	iv.	Margaret WOODWARD (1740-1801)
	<a href="#six">6</a>	v.	Susannah WOODWARD (1742-)

<p>
<a name="two"><strong>2. Lemuel WOODWARD</strong> (<a href="#one">Beamsley</a><sup>1</sup>). He was born on 16 Sep 1734 in Gloucester, Essex Co. MA. Lemuel died in York, York Co. ME on 17 Mar 1810 ((Bragdon and Frost <em>Vital Records of York, ME</em>, p.451). 
<p>
RECORD OF BIRTH: There is a record of his birth in Vital Records of Gloucester, MA, Births, p. 792 "WOODWARD, Lemuel, s. Beamsley and Sarah, Sept. 15, 1734." There is a also a record of his baptism in Vital Records of Gloucester, MA, Births, p. 792 "WOODWARD, Lemuel, s. Beamsley and Sarah [bef. 1740 bp. Aug. 13, 1738 C. R. 1.]."
<p>
On 29 Apr 1760 Lemuel married <strong>Phoebe LINSCOTT</strong>, daughter of John LINSCOTT & Tabitha BRAGDON, in York, York Co. ME (Bragdon and Frost <em>Vital Records of York, ME</em>,  p.143). She was born on 10 May 1737 in York, York Co. ME. Phoebe died in York, York Co. ME on 22 Sep 1825 (Bragdon and Frost <em>Vital Records of York, ME</em>, p.421).
<p>
He was presumably one and the same as the Lemuel Woodward who appears as a head of family in the 1790 census for Maine in York, York Co. (p. 72). In addition to himself he is listed as having 2 free white males aged 16 years or older and 3 free white females.
<p>
Lemuel WOODWARD and Phoebe LINSCOTT have been proven (from York Deeds, Vol. 83, p. 10-12) to be the parents of the following three children:
<pre>	<a href="#thirteen">13</a>	i. 	John WOODWARD
	<a href="#fourteen">14</a>	ii.	Benjamin WOODWARD
	<a href="#fifteen">15</a>	iii.	Hannah WOODWARD</pre>
<p>
Lemuel WOODWARD and Phoebe LINSCOTT appear to have been the parents of the following additional children who married in York, York Co. ME (with the exception of Susanne below):
		iv.	Sarah WOODWARD m. Joseph GRANT 11 Dec 1794
		v.	Elizabeth WOODWARD m. Benjamin SARGENT 24 Apr 1793.
		vi.	Lydia WOODWARD m. Robert TRIPE 3 Jan 1788.
		vii.	Olive WOODWARD m. Joseph TINNUM 2 Dec 1790.

<p>
<a name="three"><strong>3. Sarah WOODWARD</strong> (<a href="#one">Beamsley</a><sup>1</sup>). She was born on 28 Jun 1736 in Gloucester, Essex Co. MA.
<p>
RECORD OF BIRTH: There is a record of her birth in Vital Records of Gloucester, MA, Births, p. 792 "WOODWARD, Sarah, d. Beamsley and Sarah, June 28, 1736." There is a record of her baptism in Vital Records of Gloucester, MA, Births, p. 784 "WOODARD, Sarah, d. Bemsley, bp. Aug. 13, 1738. C. R. 1."
<p>
There is a record of a marriage intentions between a Sarah WOODWARD of Biddeford and Samuel DENNETT of Pepperrellborough (Saco) on 3 Mar  1776 on page 225 in "Early Vital Records of Saco and Biddeford, ME" NEGHR, (1917) p. 123-133 and 211-226.
<hr>
<p>
<a name="four"><strong>4. Beamsley WOODWARD</strong> (<a href="#one">Beamsley</a><sup>1</sup>). He was born on 14 Jul 1738 in Gloucester, Essex Co. MA (Vital Records of Gloucester, MA, Births, p. 791). 
<hr>
<p>
<a name="five"><strong>5. Margaret WOODWARD</strong> (<a href="#one">Beamsley</a><sup>1</sup>). She was born on 27 Jul 1740 in Gloucester, Essex Co. MA (Vital Records of Gloucester, MA, Births, p. 791). Margaret died in York, York Co. ME on 4 Mar 1801 (Bragdon and Frost <em>Vital Records of York, ME</em>, p. 405.) and was buried on 6 Mar 1801 in York, York Co. ME (Bragdon and Frost <em>Vital Records of York, ME</em>, p. 445.).
<hr>
<p>
<a name="six"><strong>6. Susannah WOODWARD</strong> (<a href="#one">Beamsley</a><sup>1</sup>). She was born in Oct 1742 in Gloucester, Essex Co. MA. (Bragdon and Frost <em>Vital Records of York, ME: Births</em>, p. 792.) The same record indicates she was baptized on 17 Oct 1742. She married <strong>David WARNER</strong>, in York, ME. They had one child:
<pre>	<a href="#sixteen">16</a>	i.	Daniel W. WARNER (1767-)</pre>
<hr>
<p>
<a name="seven"><strong>7. Simeon WOODWARD</strong> (<a href="#one">Beamsley</a><sup>1</sup>). He was born on 12 Nov 1744 in Kittery, York Co. ME (Anderson &  Thurston, eds. 1991. <em>Vital Records of Kittery to year 1892.</em> Picton Press: Camden, ME. [VR #113,  p. 13(7L)]). He was a mariner and served under Col. Allen's command (1S Mass, Maine, and NH) during the Revolutionary War. He does not appear as a separate entry in the 1790 census for York Co. ME. 
<p>
There is no record of him ever marrying in Bragdon and Frost's <em>Vital Records of York, ME</em>. Nevertheless, he appears to be the best candidate for the father of John WOODWARD of York and Waterborough, York Co. ME, as John named a son Simeon and Doris WOODWARD (above) has determined that this John could not have been the son of any of Simeon's brothers. 
<pre>	<a href="#seventeen">17</a>	i.	John WOODWARD (ca1763-1813)</pre>
<hr>
<p>
<a name="eight"><strong>8. William WOODWARD</strong> (<a href="#one">Beamsley</a><sup>1</sup>). He was born on 2 Nov 1747 in York, York Co. ME. William died in Waterborough, York Co. ME ca. Jun 1824 and was apparently buried under an unmarked field stone on his old homestead in No. Waterborough, York Co. ME (An inscribed tombstone for his namesake son William is present on this same site). A copy of his will  dated 21 Sep 1822 appears <a href="www.html">here</a>. 
<p>
RECORD OF BIRTH: Bragdon, L. (1921) "Births of the Upper Parish In York" p. 41: "Beamsley Woodward born March 11, 1710. Mary his wife born the day following March 12, 1710-- their Children. The following were born in York - William Novr. 2d 1747."
<p>
William was one of the early residents of Waterborough, York Co. ME, then known as the Plantation of Massabesick, and active it its incorporation. He signed the 1784 petition for concession on taxes on behalf of the settlers, and on 5 Apr 1787 was voted "Town Treasurer Acct" and a "Warden." (Hamilton, S. (1912) <em>The Hamiltons of Waterboro</em> Chapter 1 "Massabesick Plantation and the Town of Waterborough pp. 8 and 14). According to <em>Civil Records of Waterborough, 1787-1827</em>, William was was Sealer Of Leather (1787, 1790-92, 1814) and a Selectman for Waterborough (1787, 1790, and 1797). In 1796 he is also identified as a member of the committee to count votes, and on a committee (with James Carlisle and Eligood Mills) to build a bridge over the Little Ossippee River. He served as a surveyor of highways in 1807 and 1810. He belonged to the Free-Will Baptist Church, and in several newspaper articles is referred to as Deacon Woodward.
<p>
On 10 Jul 1779 William first married <strong>Mary JOHNSTON</strong>, daughter of Daniel JOHNSTON & Patience GRANT, in York, York Co. ME. She was born on 11 Apr 1760 in York, York Co. ME (Bragdon and Frost (1992) <em>Vital Records of York, ME</em>, p. 77). Mary died bef 1808. 
<p>
A record of Mary Johnston's birth is contained in Bragdon and Frost (1992) Vital Records of York, ME, p. 77: <em>"Daniel Johnston His Children born in York of his Wife Patience the Daughter of James Grant junr. of York... 2. Mary Johnston born Aprl. 11th 1760."</em>
<p>
RECORD OF THEIR INTENTION TO MARRY: <cite>"William Woodward and Mary Johnston both of York intend Marriage pd Enterd July 10. 1779."</em> Bragdon and Frost (1992) <em>Vital Records of York, ME</em>, p. 161 [There is no record contained in this volume of the actual marriage.] 
<p>
A 1785 proprietor's plan map of Waterborough, York ME includes a plot in the northeastern portion of Waterborough labelled "No. 29 Wm. Woodward 65 Acres" bordered on the north by  "No. 17 933 Acres", on the south it is bordered by "No. 76 Elisha Bryce 130 Acres - 120 poles" and "No. 128 Robert Bradeen 116 Acres 50 poles"
<p>
"William Woodword" appears as a head of family in the 1790 census for Maine in Waterborough Town, York Co. (p. 69). In addition to himself he is listed as having 1 free white male aged 16 or older, 1 free white male under 16 years, and 2 free white females. Doris Woodward believes the older male must have been his brother Simeon or John. John was unmarried at the time, and does appear back in Waterboro by 1795, when he was called a "Fence Viewer". It's curious that there are not more women listed- his wife, and daughters Mary and Anna.
<p>
William Woodward appears again in the 1800 census for Waterborough, York Co. ME- listed as 26-45, living with a woman aged 45+, two sons under 10, one son aged 10-16, two daughters aged under 10, two daughters aged 10-16, and a woman aged 16-26.
