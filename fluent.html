<p>
<a name="one"><strong>1. Moses<sup>1</sup> FLUANT</strong>. He was born ca. 1676. He died ca. 1747 in Beverly, Essex Co. MA. He was a member of the Congregational Church. 
<p>
RECORD OF HIS ADULT BAPTISM: <cite>"Febru. 9th [1705/6]. baptized Moses Fluant a man full grown, wo was yn admitted to full Communion."</cite> ("Beverly First Church Records" Essex Institute Historical Collection, v. 37, p. 368.)
<p>

<p>
He married <strong>Mary BRIERS</strong>, daughter of John BRIERS & Elizabeth JACKSON, on 28 Oct 1701 in Marblehead, Essex Co. MA. She was born in Gloucester, Essex Co. MA. She was baptized on  22 Apr 1716 in Second Church Of Beverly, Beverly Essex Co. MA. She died ca. 1760 in Beverly, Essex Co. MA. She was a member of the Congregational Church. 
<p>
RECORD OF THEIR MARRIAGE: <cite>"[Fluent], Moses, and Mary Briars, Oct. 28, 1701."</cite> (Marblehead marriages, p. 147.)
<p>
Moses Fluent appears on a list of the original members of the Second Church of Beverly, organized on 28 Dec 1715, according to Hurd, D. Hamilton. 1888. History of Essex County, Massachusetts. Philadelphia:  J. W. Lewis & Co. p. 696. He and his wife were active members of this church, as an article on the 2nd Congregational Church, "A Parish is formed The Precinct of Salem and Beverly, 1713-1753" written by Robert W. Lovett. Essex Institute Historical Collection, v. 98, p. 139, attests: <cite>"The care of the building during this whole period was in the hands of one family; Moses Fluent was Sexton from 1717 until 1746, and his widow, Mary, from that year until 1759. The pay began at L2 a year, reached a high point of L6 (O.T.) in 1743, and ended at L1-1-4. Since there was no bell until 1753, and no mention of heat, it seems likely that the job consisted of an occassional sweeping. In 1718 Fluent wanted to exchange land with the Precinct; and in 1757 John Fluent acquired the acre of land which the parish had designated for Rev. Chipman's use. A portion of the Wallis homestead on Conant Street is included in this lot."</cite>
<p>
Moses' name appears as the original owner of a house later occupied by his son John in "An Account of all the Houses in Beverly. May 1, 1723 and such have been built since that to May 1 1751 and a farther Account of all the Houses in Beverly which are now standing May 1 1751." compiled by Col. Robert Hale. Essex Institute Historical Collection, v. 6, p. 111. <cite>"Moses Flunt Jno Fluent"</cite>
<p>
There is a reference to a Joseph Fluent making a land transaction in 1757 in Pierce, Calvin P. (1931). <em>Ryal Side From Early Days of Salem Colony</em>. Cambridge: The Riverside Press, p. 158. He may represent a brother or more likely a son or grandson of this Moses. (Or more likely, the author intended this to refer to the transaction made by John Fluant, Moses' son noted above during the same year.)
<p>
RECORD OF HIS DEATH: <cite>"[FLUANT], Moses,---, 1747. C. R. 2"</cite> (Vital Records of Beverly, MA, Deaths p. 438; note his death does not appear among "A list of deaths in Beverly made by Col. Robert Hale [1732-1765]" that appeared in Essex Institute Historical Collection, v. 5 & 6). 
<p>
Mary (nee BRIERS) FLUANT continued to be an active member of the church after the death of her husband, as an article on the 2nd Congregational Church ("A Parish Weathers War and Dissension The Precinct of Salem and Beverly 1753-1813") written by Robert W. Lovett. Essex Institute Historical Collection, v. 99, p. 104, attests: <cite>"For several years after 1753 care of the Meeting House and ringing of the bell were in the hands of one family; Widow Mary Fluant and her son, John, divided the duties until the year 1764. Then, for a few years, Widow Mary Stanley did the sweeping and various men rang the bell. The latter job included, in the 1760's, 'carrying the bason to such as need it or deserve it.' It is not clear just what the activity was, but it may have had something to do with alms."</cite> The article goes on to mention that the person tending the Meeting House was also responsible for shovelling snow from the door and horse block. [Mary (nee Fluent) Standley was Mary Brier Fluent's daughter.]

<p>
John Fluant appears as the current owner of a house originally occupied by his father Moses in "An Account of all the Houses in Beverly. May 1, 1723 and such have been built since that to May 1 1751 and a farther Account of all the Houses in Beverly which are now standing May 1 1751." compiled by Col. Robert Hale. Essex Institute Historical Collection, v. 6, p. 111. <cite>"Moses Flunt Jno Fluent"</cite>.
<p>
He is mentioned in an article on the 2nd Congregational Church written by Robert W. Lovett. Essex Institute Historical Collection, v. 98, p. 140, regarding the building of a bell tower: <cite>"On March 9, 1753 Mr. Gott was paid L1-17-4 for hanging the bell; and on the twenty-first John Fluent was paid L1-0-0 for ringing it."</cite>
<p>
Deed for land bought by John Fluant from the Precinct in 1757 is included in Book 111, on page 258 of Deeds and Wills in the Essex County Courthouse.
<p>
Robert W. Lovett noted above has also written an article "A House and Its Inhabitants" Essex Institute Historical Collection, v. 101, pp. 42-52 describing the history of the house John built that includes the following additional details and a photograph: <cite>"John Fluant, who had served as Church Sexton, asked to buy the Conant Street land [associated with the North Beverly Church, aka the Precinct of Salem and Beverly, aka the Second Congregational Church], and the church approved. According to the deed, dated March 25, he paid L1 13s 4p for 94 poles; the money went to Rev. Chipman [then pastor of the church and 'owner' of the land]. The property was bounded on one side of land and wall by Dr. Benjaimin Jones (who lived in the house now numbered 64 Dodge Street, also owned later by the Wallis family), on other sides by Church land and by the highway. It was stipulated that 'he or they are to make and maintain wall.' John Fluant was born in 1703, and married Mary Baker in 1726. He died in 1763, so he lived but a few years in the house he built. The following year (1764) his widow sold the property to their son, Ezra, who had just married Jerusha Porter. Mary Fluant died in 1770, and the younger Fluants lived, with their four children, in the house until 1778, when they moved to York, now part of Maine. Ezra is listed in the deeds as mariner; he must have felt he could do better in this line in York. What sort of house did John Fluant build? According to Alice G. Lapham's The Old Planters of Beverly [and the Thousand Acre Grant of 1635 (Cambridge, 1930)] (and she probably obtained the information from the Wallis family) it consisted of but two rooms (p. 100). [In footnote: The second-floor rooms in the western half now look older, because they have been less changed]. A stone stairway in the basement, now blocked off, but which would lead to the present front hall, bears this out. Thus the rooms on the first and second floors to the east of the present front door would appear to be the oldest portion. According to Ezra's deed, the property measured about one-half acre, and the price was L50. Among the boundaries, the Parish land was stated to be in the occupation of Rev. Chipman, which doubtless meant that he was farming or haying it. In 1778 the Fluants sold to Josiah Trow, Jr., cordwainer, the 'messuage or tennament' for L130. The property was then said to measure about one acre, but the price represents considerable wartime inflation."</cite> (pp. 43-44).

Ezra Sr. is identified as a "collector" for the the 2nd Congregational Church of Beverly in "A Parish Weathers War and Dissension The Precinct of Salem and Beverly 1753-1813" written by Robert W. Lovett. Essex Institute Historical Collection, v. 99, p. 113: <cite>"Collectors... Ezra Fluant 1777"</cite>.
<p>
BILL OF SALE: <cite>"Ezra Fluent of Coxhall, York County [now Lyman], with consent of Jerusha, my wife, sells to Josiah Trow, jr. of Beverly, a dwelling house and land in Beverly 21 Mar 1778, signed at Coxhall- wit. John Goodrich, Hannah Porter."</cite> (Essex Co. Deeds 137-34). 
<p>
Upon the sale of his mother's old house (bought in 1764 as noted above) Ezra Sr. and his family moved to York, ME ca. 1778. He is listed on a 1779 list of people from E. Coxhall, York Co. ME on an index of pre 1790 colonial census records.
<p>
An entry for the widow " Huent" appears in the index to the 1790 census for Coxhall, York Co. ME. (<em>Heads of Families in the 1790 census</em>-Maine, p. 59)(Note that this cannot be a reference to her daughter in law Hepzibah, who had children after 1790.) Within the household are listed one free white male (16 or older), one free white male under 16, and two free white women. These presumably refer to Boanerges Raymond Fluent, Jonathan Raymond Fluent, Jerusha nee Raymond Porter Fluent (mother) and either Jerusha or Molly, depending upon which was married at the time. The "widow Fluant" or "Jerusha Fluant" appears in the 1800 for Coxhall, and also in the 1810 and 1820 censuses for Lyman (formerly known as Coxhall), York Co. ME.

OBITUARY - <cite>"Dea. ZEBULON KNIGHT died in Garland, Me., Aug. 8, aged 61 years. Bro. K. experienced a change of heart 27 years ago, was baptized by Rev. Mr. Harvey and united with the F. Baptist church in G. and was one of its most faithful and devoted members. It is truthfully said of him that a good man has fallen. His religion was not a profession merely, but a part of himself. He was one of the deacons of the church for 17 years, which office he filled to the entire satisfaction of the church. He was also treasurer of the Exeter Q.M. for many years, in which office he had the confidence of the Q.M., and was finally discharged at his own request. The prosperity of the church was his joy, its adversity his sorrow. The conference and the prayer meetings found him present and active. He was sympathetic to the poor and needy, and always contributed to their relief. During the last three months of life he was a great sufferer from mental derangement. For the most part of the time when conscious he loved to talk about Christ and heaven. Death had lost all its terror to him. As a conpanion he was faithful and confiding, as a father tender and affectionate. Bro. K. leaves a companion, three sons, one daughter, and many other relatives to mourn their loss. The funeral services were attended by the writer, assisted by Rev. A. W. Reed and Rev. Mr. Thayer. E. Harding."</cite> (The Morning Star, Dover, NH; 3 Jan 1866 v. XL no. 41). This obituary may refer to someone else--there is a discrepancy between where this Zebulon is said to have lived and the 1860 census and a ten year difference in their ages.
