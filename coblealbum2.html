<i>Note: Neither the Rudge or Coble families ever lived in Virginia to by knowledge, so photos in this location are presumably from the Pae and Bath side of the family (Caroline Virginia nee Pae married John William Rudge).

It's tempting to think 16, 10 and 19 are all of the same young woman, identified in one as Addie M. Cook.

<center><a name="three">TINTYPES</center>
<p>
As much as it would simplify things to assume the tintypes were all taken at the same time and place, tintypes 20 and 12 appear to be of the same two girls at different ages. Only the last of the five (of a little girl) was identified-- as Carrie Rudge Coble. (From the apparent style of the clothing, the writer must be referring to Carrie nee Rudge Coble and not her daughter, Caroline Rudge nee Coble Jones.) If this photo is one and the same as the youngest girl in tintypes 20 and 12, it suggests the two girls depicted are Bettie Louise Rudge (b. 1871) and Caroline Virginia nee Rudge (b.1874). If I had to guess, I'd say the woman in tintype 7 is a young Caroline Virginia nee Pae, and from her apparent age, before she was married.

25. This is a tintype of a man and a woman. Kathryn nee Coble Niven told me she was told that it was taken in Wilmington shortly before one of them died. This strongly suggests it is a photo of John and Louisa nee Mitchell Rudge.

4. This is a tintype of a girl. The name written on the back states "Carrie Rudge Coble". Notice the last word appears to have been added later, i.e. after she married.

I'm inclined to think that 17 and 26 are of the same woman, Caroline Virginia nee Pae Rudge at different ages. 17 also looks similar to tintype 7.
