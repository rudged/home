<center><h3>William Rudge of London and Portsea, England’s Ancestry</h3></center>
<p>
The following is a theory regarding <a href="rudge.html#one">1. William Rudge</a>'s ancestry. It stems from the discovery of records pertaining to a son of William and his wife Hannah, Edward Rudge, and in particular a christening record that connects William Rudge to Smethwick, Staffordshire, England. 
<p>
A 1799 marriage record for William and his wife Hannah specifically refers to William as of being of full age. After marrying they had numerous children while living in London, Smethwick, Portsea. I have been unable to find any suitable birth or baptism record for William in either London or Portsea. Moreover, there is no guarantee that merely because he was living in big city at the time of his marriage he was actually originally from that place. Smethwick was a small town that happens to have a family named Rudge, which moreover includes among its church records a baptism of a William Rudge to Samuel and Elizabeth Rudge in 1778, right about the time our William was born, as indicated by a record of his burial in 1823, in which he is described as being 45 years old. 
<p>
There is also a broad similarity in the pattern of how children were named by Samuel and later his alleged first son William on this account. William named his second son Samuel and all three of his daughters carry the name Elizabeth as either their first or middle name. Samuel had a son named John and two daughters named Ann and Sarah. 
<p>
There is one piece of evidence that might dispute that this William is indeed ours. There is a second christening record that refers to the birth of a Sarah Rudge, daughter of William and Hannah that takes place on 12 Apr 1795 in Sedgley, Staffordshire, England. This is a different locality and takes place 5 years before our William and Hannah were married. While it is estimated nearly 10% of all marriages in England at this time took place after the birth of the first child, I note that our Hannah is described as a minor in her marriage reacord, which makes it quite unlikely that she could have had a daughter in 1795.

<p>
<a name="one"><strong>1. Samuel<sup>1</sup> RUDGE.</strong>. He apparently married <strong>Elizabeth -</strong> ca. 1775. [We need to be very cautious - I've determined that the LDS records only refer to christenings in Smethwick; marriages and burials that took place in Smethwick are not included.]
<p>
They appear to be the couple referred to in the following record of marriage, which is the only one referring to the marriage of a Samuel Rudge and Elizabeth during the period 1765-1785:
<p>
MARRIAGE RECORD: <em>Samuel RUDGE married Elizabeth CARR on 18 Dec 1775 at St. Martin, Birmingham, England.</em>. (Marriage records of St. Martin, Birmingham, England, LDS Batch no. M010722, Sheet 00, Source no. 0919765-0919767, Printout 6900689) 
<p>
Samuel RUDGE and Elizabeth CARR had the following children:
<pre>	<a href="#two">2</a>	i.	Ann<sup>2</sup> RUDGE
	<a href="#three">3</a>	ii.	William<sup>2</sup> RUDGE
	<a href="#four">4</a>	iii.	Elizabeth<sup>2</sup> RUDGE
	<a href="#five">5</a>	iv.	Samuel<sup>2</sup> RUDGE

<a name="eight"><strong>8. Phoebe<sup>2</sup> RUDGE</strong> (<a href="#one">Samuel</a><sup>1</sup>). She was born ca. 1799 in Smethwick, Staffordshire, England.
<p>
This appears to be a reference to another child of Samuel and Elizabeth Rudge, as it occurs in the same location as their other christenings and there are no other couples surnamed Rudge in Smethwick having children at this time.
