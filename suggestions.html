The earlier you start to prepare, andthe more preparation you do prior to going on the job market, the easier (andhopefully more successful) the process will be. In preparing this document, wewere struck by how much preparation can be done by someone in their second orthird year in graduate school--you have everything to gain from thinkingthrough what you will do after you graduate and using the time you have at WMUto position yourself for the market.</p><p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Oneof the first things you will learn about the job market is that many aspectsare beyond your control, either because they reflect the actions and decisionsof people hundreds of miles away (e.g. Professor X decides to retire) orbecause of your own past actions/-inactions. This being said, there are <i>many</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> things you can do to improve your chances. Part ofour motivation in developing this document is to help you make the most ofopportunities you have available to you now, </span><i>before</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> you go on the job market, because once you do takethe plunge, you'll presumably be so busy with looking for jobs and completingyour dissertation that you won't have the luxury of taking advantage of the fewopportunities you have left to improve your credentials/position.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ifyou go on the market before completing your degree, recognize that while it is possibleto be hired ABD, it is still the case that, <i>depending upon the school inquestion</i><span style='font-style:normal'>, ABDs are at a substantial disadvantagecompared to other applicants. Not having the magic letters &quot;Ph.D.&quot;after your name can be the cause of immediate disqualification, particularlyfor tenure-track positions at research intensive schools. Moreover, at the timeyou decide to go on the job market, it may not be clear to you what the major implications/conclusionsof your dissertation are. People who examine your curriculum vitae (c.v.) or whointerview you will be looking for a clear indication of what the majorconclusions of your dissertation are and their significance. You will be comparedto people who have completed their dissertations, many of whom may have been onthe job market for years. If at all possible, you should indicate on your c.v.the expected date you will defend, and also state the conclusions of yourdissertation as strongly as possible, even if the details of your argument arenot yet entirely worked out.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thejob market is littered with false hopes-- there will be times when you feelvery optimistic about your chances, and (especially later in the job season)times when you question whether sending applications in search of all tooelusive jobs is worth the effort. While the job market in science education hassubstantially improved over the past decade, it can still be a very stressfulexperience for applicants. Part of the stress arises from how drawn out theprocess can be - it is often months before you learn whether or not adepartment to which you have sent your application is indeed taking youseriously. Many departments wait until an applicant has signed a formal contractbefore informing the rest of the applicants that they are no longer beingconsidered, and even then, it is generally only applicants who made the shortlist that are so advised. It's often said that an interview is only a source ofnegative information, a way of weeding candidates out. A good interview doesn'tnecessarily mean that you are indeed the candidate they are after. This isperhaps the most infuriating thing about the job market--your hopes are raisedwhen they phone you for an interview, your hopes rise still further when theinterview goes well, and then you sit by the phone waiting for a call thatnever comes. The thing to keep in mind is that, from the perspective of thehiring department, there is no reason to give any of the three candidates ontheir short list an indication that they are not the first person on theirlist: they are guarding against the possibility that their number one choicewill bail for a better offer. There's no point<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>in over analyzing the interview you had for reasons why theydidn't choose you--their decision may not reflect any weakness on your part atall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They are making a <i>comparative</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> judgement based on their specific needs.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thisdocument is divided into two sections, a calendar of what should be done when,and also a glossary of advice on particular items, many of which are <b>highlighted</b><spanstyle='font-weight:normal'> in the calendar section.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b>CALENDAR OF WHATSHOULD BE DONE WHEN<o:p></o:p></b></p><p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><i>Prior to the year you decide to go on the job market<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></i><span style='font-style:normal'>(noparticular order)</span></p><p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal>Meet with your advisor to have a candid discussion about thejob market, what he or she thinks are your strengths and weaknesses, how bestto position yourself for going on the job market.</p><p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal>Attend professional <b>conferences<o:p></o:p></b></p><p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal>Take science and education courses outside your specialty toround out your academic background and allay the concerns of hiring departmentsthat you are only capable of teaching courses in your specialty. </p><p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal>Consider refining a term paper for one of the graduatecourses you take into a published article (see <b>publishing</b><spanstyle='font-weight:normal'>).</span></p><p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal>Be on the lookout for opportunities to present your work inpublic at <b>conferences</b><span style='font-weight:normal'>, etc. There arenumerous opportunities for graduate students to present &quot;works inprogress&quot; at regional and even national science education conferences,such as the annual meetings of AETS and NARST, which are both generally held inMarch.

Make itentertaining, use audio-visual aids, make it informative, representative ofwhat your research is about; establish its significance for broader issues inscience education; include references to recent literature; have a specificargument and a conclusion; be prepared to back each claim you make; put a faceon anything audience sees as a straw man. Try to avoid the appearance of simplydescribing what you did and asking your audience to admire how great, creative,etc. it was. Your audience should leave with a clear understanding of what themajor conclusion of your talk was, what evidence you had for this conclusionand why the result is significant. When discussing research involvingcurriculum development, it is particularly impressive to share how yousystematically studied the problem, systematically thought through how youmight resolve it, and systematically collected data that allows you to evaluatethe success of whatever you used as your intervention. If you can, try topresent it without reading it--in addition to considering your merits as aresearcher, many people (appropriately or not) view the job talk as anopportunity to see what you are like as a teacher. Speak slowly and loudly.Remember to motivate and make your talk accessible to a lay person who has nobackground in science education and who may not readily appreciate thesignificance of the specific problem you have chosen to discuss--the vastmajority of your audience will fit in this category and it is their opinionthat you need to win over.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Yourwriting sample is probably a better vehicle for demonstrating your mastery oftechnical detail, which can often come across as boring to people not in yourfield. On the other hand, if you give a talk that omits significant details ofyour argument, you run the risk of having your audience think that you have notsubstantially defended your position. Most job talks end with a question andanswer period. You can probably predict what most questions will be about justby thinking through what someone who has never been exposed to a paper in yourfield would ask after hearing you; providing additional details or exampleswill help you, but if someone really does stump you, graciously agree you needto think more about that point and move on to the next question. Above all,don't get defensive. In science education, as in the sciences, it isincreasingly expected that your presentation will involve power pointpresentation. Empirical studies work well with science departments, the facultyof whom may have some reservations about whether work in science education isgenuine research. Listen to what the search committee tells you about theexpected audience- avoid technical presentations when half your audience iscomposed of undergraduates, avoid &quot;cutesy&quot; presentations that involvepassing around materials, avoid conducting your lecture as if it were a classunless they specifically ask you to teach a class. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><b>Letters of intention/letters of interest</b><spanstyle='font-weight:normal'>.

The person who notifies     you that you are being granted an interview may share with you which members     of the department will be conducting the interview--this is particularly helpful     as you can hunt down abstracts of their dissertations and search via WestCAT     for recent publications. Focus also on what they are looking for in a successful     candidate, and be prepared to provide an answer for how you would teach any     of the courses their advertisement mentions. Dress up. The interview may take     place at their suite in the hotel, or alternatively in a large room filled     with tables with multiple interviews taking place. Although the latter is     potentially distracting, once the interview begins you will probably become     oblivious to the presence of anyone else in the room but your interviewers.     Prepare to be asked very basic questions regarding who you are, what your     research is about, and how you would teach a particular sort of course. Above     all, know thy thesis. You should be able to state the thesis and conclusions     of your dissertation in 2-3 minutes, what the relevance of your work is to     broader issues in science education, and what specific projects you plan to     work on after you complete your dissertation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;     </span>Practice answering questions directly in the very first sentence of     your response, elaborating as needed in additional sentences. If possible,     try to present a common theme to your interests.

Your questions may focus on the writing sample you submitted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;     </span>You should do similar preparations with regard to the courses you claim     in your c.v.

One way to prepare     for questions about particular classes is to begin by identifying the instructional     goal/goals you would strive for in teaching that class, and how your choice     of course materials, class format, and measures of evaluation meet those goals.     Be prepared to generalize your specialty - show that you are familiar and     competent to teach in more than just the one or two subjects addressed in     your dissertation. For any area of competence you list (or course you claim     you can teach) you may be asked a general question like &quot;whose views     on constructivism are you most sympathetic to?&quot; Other questions to consider     prior to interviews - &quot;briefly discuss your best/worst teaching experience&quot;,     &quot;what do you see as the connection between your research and your teaching?&quot;,     &quot;how do you motivate students who take your courses?&quot;, and &quot;what     is the significance of your research in the broader context of science education     in general?&quot;<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not everyone is a good interviewer--you     should come to the interview with a set agenda of what you would like to cover     and make sure you cover all the bases, without coming across as domineering.     Have some specific questions in mind for your interviewers--to the extent     that you can, you need to convey both that you are interested in the position     and are enthusiastic about the prospect of working with them (e.g. do you     have a undergraduate organization devoted to the needs of preservice math     and science teachers? does your department have a colloquium series? what     sort of committee work would you like the person you hire to do?). If you     plan to travel in the area, consider rerouting a trip you were going to make     anyway by way of the institution in question and ask to visit the department.     At smaller schools, the day long interview may involve meetings with small     groups of faculty for an hour over the course of a day, and will in addition     invite you to meet with students.

Like your c.v. it should be short--1-4 pages.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(<i>Nota bene</i></span>- you are usingthe t.p. to get a job, not win a teaching award, don't let anyone tell you thatit must include pages of documentation on your teachingeffectiveness--prospective employers will <i>not</i><span style='font-style:normal'> read it.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not yetstandard in our field and may suggest to the person you send it to that youvalue teaching more highly than doing research. On the other hand, it may helpyou land a position at a school that values teaching and has fears aboutwhether you will take your teaching seriously. At minimum it should include (1)basic information about how to contact you (postal and email addresses as wellas telephone numbers), (2) your current teaching position and responsibilities,(3) your past teaching responsibilities, (4) a statement of your teachingphilosophy, (5) lists of publications, presentations and awards associated withyour teaching, (6) a brief mention of what courses you are prepared to teach,(7) a list of activities you have done to improve yourself as an instructor.You should also attach a sample of an instructional aid that you have/woulduse, such as a syllabus or other handout. When<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>you write up your teaching responsibilities past andpresent, be sure to include details on the nature of the course, thecomposition and number of students taking it, their general level of ability,and anything else seems relevant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Be prepared to back absolutely every claim you make--if one thing is inaccurateit will throw the legitimacy of the whole into question--e.g. you should have asyllabus in mind (if not on paper) for every course you claim you are preparedto teach. Misspelled words also say a lot about you.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is a lot of stylistic variation in how to presentyourself--best rule of thumb is to find copies of teaching portfolios frompeople who has recently gone on the job market in our field from a positionsimilar to yours and use this as a guide with regard to what to include.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Overly ornate teaching portfolios maysuggest you are trying to dress up weak credentials. Be brief and to thepoint--when possible, substitute lists for written paragraphs. Develop it fromthe perspective of an interviewer--what information would you need to decidewhether to consider or reject a candidate?</span></p><p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><b>Writing sample/Dossier paper</b><span style='font-weight:normal'>: should both indicate your ability to explain new material to a layperson and also convince your reader you have a mastery for technical detail.(You might wish to consider submitting two samples, one of which reveals yousomeone who can explain things well, another that shows your grasp of details.)It should be polished and brief (10-15 pages).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should also be indicative of your general researchinterests--they want to read something that gives them an indication of what yourresearch is all about and the best example you have to offer of your ability towrite well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It should indicate youare abreast of the current literature. You should make a point of documentingwho adheres to any position you disagree with, put a specific face on youralleged opposition--this also clarifies to your audience that what you aredoing is significant, rather than a made up problem.
