<a name="one"><strong>1. Captain Luke<sup>1</sup> MILLS</strong>. He was born on 20 Jun 1713 in Northampton Co., Virginia (William and Mary College Quarterly, series (1), vol. 8, p. 275; New England Historical and Genealogical Society, v. 79, pp. 218-220). He died in 1764 in Portsmouth, Rockingham Co. NH. He was a sea captain involved in Mediterranean trade. A theory regarding Captain Luke Mill's ancestry is located <a href="luke.html">here</a>.
<p>
A shipping list at Port of Piscataqua 1746-7 includes the Brigs name "Mosepony" under Capt. Luke Mills. He is also listed as sailing on the Sloop Neptune from Antigua into Port of Pistcataway, reported in NH Gazette Thurs. 7 Oct 1756.  (These are not references to his namesake son, who was also a captain, because the son was only 5 and 15 years old at these two times.)
<p>
He married first <strong>Hannah LANG</strong>, daughter of John LANG & Grace BROOKIN, on 5 Dec 1734 in Portsmouth, Rockingham Co., NH. She was born ca. 1715 in Portsmouth, Rockingham Co., NH. She was baptized on 7 Aug 1715 in South Church, Portsmouth, Rockingham Co. NH. She died between 1746-1748 in Portsmouth, Rockingham Co., NH.

<cite>"14 Hannah (3) John (2), Robert (1), baptized August 7, 1715, she was dead before her thirty third year, when her father made his will. She married Dec. 5, 1734, Luke Mills, who was of Northampton County, Virginia, a master mariner (that is, usually taken to be, ship captain) and warehouseman. He was born in Virginia June 20, 1715. He was lost at sea in the summer of 1764, under 50 years of age. He left a will dated June 20, 1764, made, probably in anticipation of a long voyage. It was proved in August 29th of the same summer. After the death of Hannah, he married again, as his wife's name in the will was Deborah, which also mentioned his surviving children, Luke, Eligood, and Mary" </cite> (From Moore, Howard P. (1918) "A Genealogy of the Lang Family", p. 60).
<p>
Luke MILLS and Hannah LANG had the following children, who were all baptized at the South Church in Portsmouth, Rockingham, NH ("Records of the South Church of Portsmouth, N.H., Baptisms & Admissions in the Ministry of Rev. William Shortleff 1732-1747", New England Genealogical and Historical Register (1927) pp. 447):

RECORD OF DEATH<cite>"Captain Luke Mills was lost at sea being swept overboard in a gale while standing on the deck of his ship, by the side of his son Elligood, who according to tradition tried to jump overboard in a hopeless attempt to rescue his father, but was restrained by the crew. Capt. Mills was on a voyage to the West Indies at the time of his death."</cite> (Hiram Mills' notes taken from the "Granite Monthly" Vol. LIII. Obtained at the Portsmouth Athenaeum, Portsmouth NH.)
<p>
His will was dated 20 Jun 1764 and proved 29 Aug 1764. <cite>"[From his last will] one can see that he was well settled in Portsmouth, NH, with his shipping business and all. He apparently picked up a good sized piece of land, taking into consideration the fact that he had his own wharf and warehouses, plus his main house and the one he was building for his daughter Mary.  His first three children had very little history if any"</cite> (Hiram Mills). A transcript of his will appears <a href="lmwill.html">here</a>.
<p>
According to the will, Luke MILLS married a second time to  <strong>Deborah -</strong>. The marriage took place by 5 Jun 1754 in Rockingham Co. NH (Rockingham Deed Book 45 p. 38). She was born ca. 1710 and died in Portsmouth, Rockingham Co. NH on 18 Mar 1786. (The precise details have been hard to figure out because his namesake son was also a sea captain and also married a woman named Deborah).

<a name="three"><strong>3. Elligood<sup>2</sup> MILLS Sr.</strong> (<a href="#one">Luke</a><sup>1</sup>). He was born on 25 Aug 1744 in Portsmouth, Rockingham Co. NH. He was baptized on 6 Jul 1744 at the South Church, Portsmouth, Rockingham Co. NH. He died on 1 Jan 1832 in Waterborough, York Co. ME. It appears he and his two wives were originally buried either in Biddeford or on his family’s land in North Waterborough, but were eventually reburied in the Elder Grey Meeting House Cemetery, North Waterborough, York Co. ME. He was a farmer, a member of the Congregational Church of Limerick, Limerick, York Co. ME, and an early settler of Waterboro, York Co. ME. According to family tradition (discussed below), he was an officer aboard the privateer "Gard Turk" during the American Revolutionary War.

<p>
York county deeds suggest Eligood and his second wife Lucy moved from Biddeford to Limerick (just north of Waterborough) by 22 Mar 1789.
<p>
<cite>A 1785 proprietor's plan map of Waterborough, York ME includes a plot on the northern edge of Waterborough labeled "Eligood Mills 185 Acres No. 91" bordered on the north by  the little Ossipee River, to the east by an unnamed road that runs north-south, and three unowned plots to the west and south ("539 acres 60 poles No. 15", "122 Acres 30 poles No. 14", and "No. 90")</cite>
<p>
<cite>"It will be noticed that there is a gap of almost five and one-half years between the birth of Luke Mills, son of Eligood [sr.], and that of Eligood's next child William. Family tradition states that Eligood Mills [sr.] was an officer of the privateer Grand Turk, which was outfitted by the Leightons at Portsmouth in 1777 or 1778, and that on her second voyage she was captured by a British frigate and taken into Halifax, where the officers and crew were kept prisoners till the treaty of peace had been signed. The Leightons, relatives of Eligood Mills [sr.] by marriage-his sister Mary was married at Portsmouth, 8 Aug. 1765 (South Church Records) to Paul Leighton of Portsmouth- were ruined by this and other losses, and Eligood Mills [sr.], who had left his property in their charge, shared in the ruin. He followed the sea for some time after the close of the Revolution, and then removed to Waterborough, Me. as early as 1790 (Census) where he died."</cite>(New England Genealogical and Historical Register (1925) v. 79 p. 220.)
<p>
Among the town records of Waterboro for 1796, he is listed on a committee with James Carlisle and William Woodward to build a bridge over the Little Ossipee River.
<p>
CENSUS RECORDS: <strong>1790</strong> Eligood Mills Sr. appears as a head of family in the 1790 census for Maine in Waterborough Town, York Co. (p. 69). In addition to himself he is listed as having 1 free white males 16 or over, 3 free white males under 16 years and 3 free white females. These entries presumably refer to his son Eligood jr., his sons Luke, William and John, his wife Lucy nee McLucas Mills, and his daughters Lucy and Lydia. <strong>1800</strong> Eligood Mills Sr. is present as a head of household in the 1800 census for Waterboro, referred to as "Elihood"; the household is listed as having two boys aged under 10, one man aged 10-16, one man aged 26-45; two women aged 16-26, and one woman aged 26-45. These entries presumably refer to his sons James, John and William, Eligood himself, his daughters Lydia and Lucy and his wife Lucy. <strong>1810</strong> Eligood Mills Sr. is present as a head of household in the 1810 census for Waterboro; the household is listed as having one man aged 16-26, one man aged 45 and older; one girl aged under 10, one woman aged 26-45, and one woman aged 45 and older. These entries presumably refer to his son James, Eligood himself, his daughter Lucy and his wife Lucy. It is unclear who the girl under 10 years of age would be, but presumably it is a reference to a grandchild by one of the sons of his first marriage, who each had a daughter of this age at the time. <strong>1820</strong> I believe he is present in the entry for his son Luke in the 1820 census for Hollis, York Co. ME (see below).  <strong>1830</strong> Eligood Mills Sr. is present as a separate head of household in the 1830 census, the household includes a man and woman both 80-90 years old.

Paul Leighton is listed as a head of family in the 1790 census for Portsmouth Town, Rockingham Co. (p. 80). In addition to himself he is listed as having 1 free white male 16 or over, 6 free white males under 16 years and 3 free white females. These entries presumably refer to his seven sons (with the exception of his eighth son Luke, who is listed as a separte entry), two of his daughters and his wife. If we assume that the children were baptized the year they were born, there is a discrepancy to be explained--there should be 5 free white males under 16 and 2 over 16. (A late baptism would not explain this). Perhaps one of the Johns was married yet living at home with a wife and a young son. At least two and as many as three of the daughters would have had to have been married at this time.

OBITUARY: <em>"DIED... In this town, Mrs. MARY LEIGHTON, aged 76, widow of the late Mr. Paul Leighton. Few persons have acted their part on the stage of life with greater propreity than Mrs. L. As a mother, she manifested a providence and had tenderness for her children, a solicitude for their present and future well being, which did equal  honor to her understanding and her heart. She was a pattern of enterprise and industry to the indigent and sick. Her religion was reasonable homage of grateful piety to a beneficient Being, sanctioned by reason and enlightened by revelation. But though a christian, she was not a bigot. Her mind disclaimed the thraldom of superstition, nor could be wrought upon to view the Author of the universe as a relentless tyrant. She looked forward to a state of retribution, with a humble confidence. As a member of Christ's church, her behavior was correct and exemplary-she loved and frequented the ordiance and worship of God. Of an amiable and affectionate heart, she was an object of universal regard. She wished not her friends to envy her that happiness she was going to enjoy, and observed that death was to her a pleasant summons. She resigned her gentle spirit to the "commissioned angel" and soared on airy pinions to relams of endless bliss."</em> (New Hampshire Gazette (Portsmouth, NH) 3 June 1823, v. LXVIII, Issue 28, page 3).

<cite>"No. Waterboro Apr. 1, 1898. Mr. Bean: Dear Sir. In answer to your questions, I would say that Luke Mills was born in Waterboro Oct 1773 and he married Miss Betsy Goodwin I think of Brownfield, but the date of his marriage or when he moved to or from Brownfield I cannot tell as I have no records of the events. But he left Waterboro about 1830. He moved to the town of Corinna, Maine. His children's names were Hattie, Mark, Betsy, Jerome, Charles, Caroline, and Azro. I could not say how many were born in Brownfield or how many in Waterboro as there is no record that I know of in relation to this matter. John Mills was a brother of Luke, as was my father. Now I think I have given you all the information that I can with what records I have and would refer you to Mr. Azro Mills, Corinna, Maine. Perhaps he can give you all the information you want. Hoping you get all the information you may want from him, I will close. Yours truly, James Mills." </cite> (Loose Letter in Collection #1151, inserted in page 269 of Volume 1, part of the Maine Historical Society's collection, 485 Congress St., Portland, ME 04101-3498.

<p>
CENSUS RECORDS: <strong>1820</strong> Luke is present as a head of household in the 1820 census for Waterborough, York Co. ME; the household is listed as having three boys aged under 10, two boys aged 10-16, one man aged 16-26, one man aged 26-45, one man aged 45 and older; two girls aged under 10, two girls aged 10-16, one woman aged 26-45 and one woman aged 45 and older. 3 are listed as being engaged in agriculture. I am not sure how to account for all these entries. Presumably his father Eligood sr. and mother Lucy account for the eldest entries. Luke would be the man aged 26-45, and his wife Betsey the woman aged 26-45. The other female entries are all accounted for: Henrietta (14) and Syrena (12) are the two girls aged 10-16; Betsey (7) and Lydia (1 ) are the two girls under ten.  I can account for two of the boys under 10: Mark L (7) and Jerome (2). This leaves one boy under 10, two boys 10-16 and the one man aged 16-26 unaccounted for. <strong>1830</strong> Luke is present as a head of household in the 1830 census for Waterborough; the household is listed as having one boy aged under 5, one boy aged 5-10, one boy aged 10-15, one man aged 15-20, one man aged 50-60; one girl aged under 5, one girl aged 5-10, one woman aged 15-20, one woman aged 20-30 and one woman aged 40-50. These entries can be accomodated for just with reference to Luke's immediate family. His son Azro (5) would be the entry 5 and under, son Charles B (7) the entry 5-10, son Jerome (12) the entry 10-15, son Mark L. (19) the entry 15-20; Hannah (1) the entry under 5; Lydia (10) the entry 5-10; Betsey (17) the entry 15-20; Syrena (22) the entry 20-30; wife Betsey (48) would be the woman 40-50. (His parents Eligood and Lucy are once again present in the census as separate entries. Henrietta (24) was presumably married by this time and living on her own.)
<p>
There are a number of references to Luke Mills in records of meetings of the Town of Waterborough from 1812-1834. On 6 Apr 1812 he was chosen and sworn as a surveyor of highways and also a Hayward and Fence Viewer. On 5 Apr 1813 he was again elected a surveyor of highways and a Hayward and Fence viewer. On 3 Apr 1815 he was chosen as a surveyor of highways. On 7 Apr 1817 he was chosen as a surveyor of highways and also a Hayward and Fence Viewer. On 4 May 1818 he was again chosen as Hayward and Fence Viewer. On 29 Jan 1820 he was chosen as "Clerk Protempere", where he is also listed as winning the bid to support Sally Hutchings and her youngest child for 98 cents. Chosen as a surveyor of highways again on 15 Mar 1821. On 1 May 1821 he was chosen as a hayward and fence viewer. On 1 Apr 1822 he was chosen as a member of a committee to say when the town poor shall have a doctor; and also chosen as a member of a committee to oversee the construction of a pound. On 7 Apr 1822 he was accepted as Constable and Collector. On 4 Apr 1825 he was voted and sworn a tythingman. On 17 Oct 1825, a town meeting discussed what to do about a certain sum of orders lost when Luke as collector that year; a subsequent meeting on 31 Oct 1825 chose a committee to "settle with Luke Mills," and while the town voted to pay said committee, Luke was made liable for paying any witnesses. On 3 Apr 1826 he was chosen a Hayward and Fenceviewer. On 7 May 1827 he was chosen a tithingman. On 5 May 1828 and 2 Mar 1829 he was chosen as a school agent. On 4 May 1929 he was chosen as a tythingman and a surveyor of lumber. On 22 Oct 1831 he was chosen for a committee to divide repairs on a fence between Samuel Davis and John Whood. On 5 May 1834 he was chosen as surveyor of lumber. On 8 Sep 1834 he was chosen as a juror.

BIOGRAPHICAL ENTRY: <em>"Corinna in War... Luke Mills was a lieutenant of militia during the war of 1812 and was called into service for a short time when Portland was threatened with an attack of the British. This was prior to his residence in Corinna. His father, Eligood Mills, was captain of a merchant ship in the Mediterranean trade before the Revolution and during the war served on a privateer, sailing under letters of marque from the Continental Congress. This vessel was captured on its second voyage by a British frigate and its officers and crew imprisoned at Halifax, N.S. until the end of the war.They were then taken to Boston on a British ship to be released, but were told that the colonies had been subdued, Washington and the members of the Continental Congress hanged, and that they themselves were to be transported to England and hanged for piracy. They believed the story, and Mills and two others escaped, by jumping overboard and swimming three miles to land. They found themselves near a fisherman's cabin at the mouth of the Piscataqua River in New Hampshire. There they first learned that the colonies had gained independence from England. The late Azro Mills recalled hearing his grandfather tell of this incident."</em> (A Brief History of Corinna)

OBITUARY - <cite>"OLDEST CITIZEN PASSES AWAY. William Mills of Saco Dies at Great Age. On Wednesday, February 28 [1913] at his home on the outer Portland road, Saco, occurred the death of William Mills, who was probably the oldest citizen of Saco at the time of his death. His age was 93 years, seven months and 19 days. Death was due to old age. He had had very good health for years past and began to show signs of approaching death comparatively recently. Mr. Mills was born in Waterboro, the son of William and Mary (Woodward) Mills. His occupation for the greater part of his life was farming and he had lived at the place of his death for many years. Good care of himself and a healthful occupation contributed in large measure to his long life, though he must have had an excellent constitution. For quite a good many years past he had been unable to work because of his great age and bodily weakness, but being fortunate in having a good home and tender care, he passed the last years of his life in comfort and free from worry. He made his home with his grandson, Edgar E. Mills, who conducts a large farm on the Portland road not far from the Flag Pond road. A son of deceased died some years ago. Mr. Mills was a man highly respected by all his neighbors and acquaintances. Though he had been out of active life for a long time and his death is doubtless a release from the infirmities of great age, his passing will be heard of with sorrow. He was a kind husband and father and as an inmate of the household of his  grandson was greatly beloved. He will be missed as much as any active member of the family could be. Mr. Mills is survived by one son and many relatives in this section. The funeral will be held at the home of the grandson, Friday afternoon at 2 o'clock."</cite>

Her father came to Bangor from Massachusetts in the "thirties," and practically her entire life was spent in the family home corner of Penobscot and Pine Streets. Devotion to family and to native place were among her prominent traits. After short periods of teaching in Bangor and elsewhere and a brief married life, she entered the employ of the old Bangor Mechanic Association in 1876 as cataloguer. From that date to the end, her life was devoted to library work. It was at once her profession and her recreation. The spirit of faithful service could have no finer example than was hers: Ever striving after and slowly attaining better things. The path of progress led through discouragements of various sorts, small remuneration, wretched quarters, and finally, after she had laboriously built up a collection that stood third in size among Maine's libraries, the disappointment of seeing it all swept away in the fire of 1911. Mrs. Curran never enjoyed robust health and for many years past was handicapped by increasing weight and bodily weakness. But weakness with her never extended beyond the physical plane, no one ever left her presence without feeling that there was a woman of strong individuality, and even the last days of her life brought no failure in mental faculties. In her chosen profession she was one of the last representatives of the older school of libraries, combining a wide acquaintance with general literature, an exhaustive knowledge of her own library and a remarkable familiarity with her community. Such a librarian was the index and the key to the books in her keeping. In our day, the rapid multiplying of literature, especially in certain lines, has gone far beyond the grasp of any individual mind. Library service necessarily is coming to lay greater stress on problems of administration and extension and to lean more and more on the available sources of information such as reference books, catalogues, indexes, bibliographies, and the like. Still personal service is invaluable, and there is small wonder that some of the older patrons never become reconciled to the new conditions. Mrs. Curran's industry was prodigious. Every work added to the Library was classified and entered in the accession book by herself down to the end of her active service in 1915. Perhaps history and genealogy were her favorite studies; inquirers in these fields were sure of thorough research accuracy and sound advice not infrequently after days and weeks of investigation. She was devoted to her profession at large and it was her custom to attend some of the meetings of the American Library association held in various parts of the Union. She thus formed a wide acquaintance among the leading librarians of the country. For years she was a member of the Massachusetts Library club and was one of the last survivors of the little group who in 1891 organized the Maine Library association. It had always been her hope to entertain this body in Bangor some day, but conditions in the old quarters forbade it. When in October 1915  the association did come to Bangor for its annual meeting, though she had been eight months out of active service she made the effort necessary to come down to the public library, ascended to the upper floor which she had never seen before, was present to welcome the guests and listened to the reading of a paper prepared for herself for the occasion. She never left home again in life. After the fire of 1911 she started with indomitable energy to gather the collection anew, and the first 20,000 volumes added under her direction as well as her comprehensive plans for series of local and other scrap books will place all future users of the library in her debt. But advancing years and infirmities and the administrative details made necessary by the new building then under construction led her in 1912 to express to the Board of Managers her wish to resign the librarianship. The next spring, on the appointment of her successor, the position of associate librarian was created for her and she was reelected annually, the last time in January 1917. At length, even the physical exertion of coming down to the Library became to great and in February 1915, she was relieve of that also and thereafter her services consisted chiefly in the compilation and transcription of various records. A considerable number of volumes neatly and carefully written by her hand will remain evidence of her industry during this period. Her wise counsel, loyal assistance and helpfulness, through these last years have been of the utmost value to her successor. C. A. Flagg." </cite> (Commercial February 24, 1917); 2nd. Obituary- <cite> "QUARTER OF CENTURY PUBLIC LIBRARY HEAD. Mrs. Mary H. E. Curran Served Longest Term of Bangor Public Librarians. IN LIBRARY WORK 37 YEARS. Graduated from Bangor High School In 1857-Devoted to Her Work-Authority on Books. Mrs. Mary H. E. Curran, librarian of Bangor public library from 1888 to 1913, the longest term in the history of that institution or of any Bangor libraries, died at her home on Penobscot Street, Monday afternoon, after an illness that became serious only a short time ago, although she had not been in good health for several years. Mrs. Curran practically spent her life among books. She early became an assistant to Dean Holman, for years librarian of the Mechanics association, the predecessor of the Bangor public library, and when he concluded his duties as librarian of the latter in 1888, she became librarian. She occupied this post for 25 years, until 1913, when she was succeeded by Charles A. Flagg. After that she was associate librarian until her death. Mrs. Curran was born in Bangor in 1839, the daughter of Edward Ellison, and graduated from Bangor high school in 1857. She taught in the public schools from 1868-1872. In the latter year she married N. F. Curran, whom she survived. In 1876, she became assistant to Daniel Holman of the Bangor Mechanic institute, and remained in library work for 37 years. Her only near relative is her sister, Miss Sarah E. Ellison. She was always a lover of books and reading. It was profoundly true that she loved every detail of the library work and was always eager to bring about some improvement that would render better service to library patrons. An excellent penman, her handiwork was familiar to those who frequented the old library, before the days of typewriters. The great tragedy of her life was the destruction by fire of the public library in the conflagration of 1911, a disaster that Mrs. Curran foresaw as a possibility when she wrote these words in 1897 at a time when she wrote a history of the public libraries in Bangor: "The library is still in Kenduskeag block, but we hope the time is not far distant when we shall have a building for library purposes alone, and thus protect our valuable collection from the great danger of fire." But after the fire, Mrs. Curran took up with courage the heroic task of reassembling a collection of books, to replace the magnificent library of 70,000 that had been destroyed, and made splendid progress in this work until she laid down the active duties of librarian. An associate librarian in the new library, her long experience and vast fund of knowledge were invaluable in establishing the library in its new and beautiful home. She acted as secretary of the Bangor Historical society and cabinet keeper from 1902 to 1910. Mrs. Curran was highly regarded among the librarians in the state for her comprehensive knowledge of library matters and her willingness to cooperate. One of the great losses of the fire was the destruction of a manuscript copy of a history of Bangor written by Mrs. Curran, painstakingly copied from newspaper files and other first sources. Material that is irreplaceable was burned. Funeral services will be held at the residence, 54 Penobscot street where she was born and always lived, on Thursday afternoon at 2:30 o'clock."</cite> (Commercial Feb. 20, 1917)

<p>
OBITUARY -<em>"MRS. E. R. BOLINGER -------- Isadore, daughter of Jerome and Ermaline Mills, was born March 12, 1860, in Maples [sic.] Co., Illinois.  She was stricken with a heart attack in her home in Mankato, Kansas, August 18, 1948.  She had just come to town for the day.  She was the last member of her family to pass away. Her father died when she was four years old.  Later, her mother brought her children and came out to Kansas, settling on a farm north of Pleasant Ridge School House in Jewell County.  It was in this home that Isadore Mills married E. R. Bolinger March 30, 1881.  Their new home was a sod house on the farm where they spent sixty-two years together, sharing the hardships and pleasures of life.  They later moved into a new frame house.  On this farm they reared their family of two sons and two daughters.  They added to their own family by bringing up one foster daughter from babyhood and two others who lived in their home as tho they were members of the family. Poor health caused Mr. and Mrs. Bolinger to have a sale and move to their home on East Madison St. in Mankato, from whence Mr. Bolinger departed this life in September, 1945.  Mrs. Bolinger continued to live in this home until this spring when her health caused her to cease living alone.  She was spending the summer with her children, with plans laid to return to her own house this fall with a granddaughter as her companion. She was baptized in the Methodist church, but later came to prefer the United Brethren Church.  She was kind and thoughtful of everyone, always doing things to help others.  In her active days she was a member of the Royal Neighbors and Rebekahs.  Her life was characterized by hard work, but her work was sweetened with a love of a garden, flowers and birds.  She raised a garden, both of vegetables and flowers, and always kept a singer canary. Her life companion, a daughter, three grandsons and a great grandson have departed this life before her.  Those left to mourn her passing are her children:  Mrs. Josie Countryman of Cabool, Mo., Frank of Superior, Nebr., Charles of Ionia, Ks., and their families; her three foster daughters: Mrs. Edna Love of Mankato, Nellie Thomas of Ionia, Ks., and Mrs. Beulah Sample of Los Angelas, Calif.  There are also a brother-in-law and sister-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Rudy Bolinger of Denver, Colo., and a sister-in-law, Mrs. Ida Stone of Stillwater, Okla.; seven grandchildren, six great grandchildren and a host of nieces, nephews and many kind friends. Services were held in the Mankato Evangelical United Brethren Church under direction of the pastor, Rev. Harold R. Megill.  Rev. L. B. Tremaine, a life long friend and retired Methodist minister of Lebanon, brought the sermon.  Interment was made in the Ionia cemetery beside her husband.  Pallbearers were:  John Love, Sr., Robt. Reystead, Charles Alldredge, George Hull, Lawrence Stedman and Leonard Clevenger.. Those from a distance were:  Mrs. Geo. Countryman of Cabool, Mo., and Mr. and Mrs. Francis Haynes of Kansas City, Mo."</em>  (Unknown newspaper believed to be from Mankato, KS, dated Thursday, August 26, 1943 [sic.]{Based on dates given in obituary, the correct date is believed to be August 26, 1948--MKM}

OBITUARY:<cite>"North Waterboro. Mrs. Melissa J. Davis died Saturday morning at the home of her daughter, Mrs. Eva Shapleigh at West Lebanon. Altho she had been in poor health for some time, the news of her heath [sic] came as a great shock to her relatives and friends. Mrs. Davis was in her 81st year. She was born in this town, the only daughter of Jacob and Jane (Mills) Bradeen, and a good many years of her life were passed in this place. She was a woman of pleasing, personably and sterling qualities, one who made and kept many friends. The blow fell heaviest, however, on the daughter, with whom she had made her home since the death of her husband, Samuel Davis, some years ago. Scarcely two months ago Mrs. Shapleigh's husband passed away, and now in the death of her mother she is doubly bereaved. One son, Dr. Ansel Davis of Springvale, is left; two grandchildren; and four brothers, Alonzo and Henry L. Bradeen of North Waterboro; Niles Bradeen of Springvale and Rev. Frank Bradeen of Vermont. The funeral services were held Monday at West Lebanon, with interment in the family lot here."</cite> (11 May 1917 The Sanford Tribune and Advocate p. 2)

<cite>"Atmosphere of Mrs. Fanny M. McDaniel's Home is Most Inviting- Her house reminds the visitor of the Comforts of By-gone Days. One of the Outstanding Features of it Is an Old Spinning Wheel. Those who have visited the home of Mrs. Fanny M. McDaniel on quiet Church Street in Gorham, have  come away with the same interest, and enthusiasm-for, as one steps into the long parlor, they are impressed by the very atmosphere of the place and immediately take a step backward into the far distant past. It is, indeed, a refreshing experience in contrast to the sketchy manner of present day living, and recalls to memory the comforts of bygone days. Perhaps one of the most outstanding features as one enters the room is the old spinning wheel with its fine strands of yarn suspended-while in the large window in the front is the baby spinning wheel of earlier origin. In the opposite corner is the old flax wheel and its hand reel used by the ladies in counting each strand of yarn, also the clock reel used at a later period. Beside the fireplace stands the brass warming-pan, miniature three-legged iron pot; mortar and  pestle; tin baker, while over the mantle rests the old flintlock gun, a relic from a soldier who fell in the Revolutionary War, and a tin lantern hangs at one corner. There are a number of hooked and hand braided rugs, old prints and dishes, while one of the rare possessions is the picture of the ship used in laying the Atlantic Cable with hand-made pine cone and bur frame. Among her prized collection is the old red wooden cradle-and the children's display of old fashioned toys and dolls. During a visit to Mrs. McDaniel's home, some of the interesting facts relating to her life were disclosed. Born and reared in a Christian home, she was early taught to "Remember the Sabbath Day to Keep it Holy." At age of three years, with an older sister [Amanda], she began  to attend day school, and when only seventeen years old she taught in the schools of her town. Early in life she began the study of music, and at the age of ten became a member of the church choir-for a number of years she gave both piano and vocal lessons to a large class. She is an expert in the art of spinning, hand carding of wool and weaving, and still possesses the ancient loom and wheel which furnished clothes for the family in the olden days. She has given exhibitions in spinning at many public affairs, always in old fashioned costume with full waist and skirt, lace cape, black silk apron and white ruffled hat. At the one hundredth anniversary of our State, she gave a demonstration in Portland when hundreds visited her booth. She aroused much interest and enthusiasm at the celebration of Old Home Day sponsored by the Woman's Club of Gorham, when, in old fashioned costume, she gracefully performed the difficult task of carding wool and spinning the rolls into yarn. At the annual Dorcas Fair at Quillote the coming summer she is to give an exhibition. Mrs. McDaniel belongs to a patriotic family-her great grandfather, Eligood Mills, was an officer in the War of the Revolution, and was in prison at Halifax for five years. Her grandfather, William Mills, served in the War of 1812; a number of cousins were in the Civil War, one cousin and her son-in-law were in the World War. She is a life member of the Daughters of the American Revolution and the Daughters of 1812. She takes a keen interest in public affairs, is an ardent supporter of Women's Suffrage and was the first woman to vote in the town of Gorham. She was secretary of the First Republican Woman's Club in town. She is a member of the Women's Christian Temperance Union and in 1922, attended the World's Women's Christian Temperance Union in Philadelphia. She was married to Mr. Ivory McDaniel of Hollis and they have two daughters, Mrs. Grace Cleaves of New York City, and Mrs. Geneva M. Woods, a student at Columbia University, both members of the D. A. R.  Mrs. McDaniel has traveled quite extensively visiting places of interest from Maine to California, Mexico, Canadian cities and some of the islands of the Sea- and hopes some day to enjoy a trip to foreign lands."</cite>

<cite>"The School Reunion - Around 1940 Aunt Fanny Mills McDaniel wrote and directed a reunion-type play following the idea of experiences in her years as a teacher. Her former students were the actors and actresses. It is obvious that she had everyone's complete attention. I was there somewhere (Age 13?). Aunt Fannie led the singing-flag salute etc. She had poetry and other readings, questions and "answeres"-all in good fun. Those participating were rigged up for the occasion, held at East Waterboro, at the rear of Mel Knight's general store & Post Office."</cite> (Nancy Goddard)

<cite>Gorham News - "50 Year Resident 90 On Sunday- Gorham Aug. 15- Mrs. Fanny M. McDaniels, a resident of Gorham for more than 50 years will observe her 90th birthday Sunday. Open house will be kept from 4 to 6 p. m. by her daughters Mrs. Lincoln Cleaves and Mrs. Ralph . Stiehl of New York. Mrs. McDaniels is a member of the First Parish Congregational Church, the WCTU, the Maine Federation of Women's Clubs and the Maine Federation of Garden Clubs. She belongs to the Elizabeth Wadsworth Chapter, DAR, and the Portland Chapter, , Daughters of 1812. She is one of the few persons who can spin yarn at a wheel, and she has given demonstrations at various social activities during past years. She was born in Waterboro, in 1855 and one of her earliest recollections is her fondness for music, no  doubt encouraged by her father, a teacher of the old singing school. She joined the choir of the Waterboro church when 10 years of age, and was a choir member of various churches over a period of 60 years. She taught in the Waterboro, Limerick, and Hollis schools for 20 years. She founded the Waterboro School Club of 1874, enrolling her former pupils, 22 of whom are now living. An annual event for the past 10 years, the club held its reunion at Waterboro Saturday, when a cake was presented to Mrs. McDaniels."</cite>

<cite>"Just to New York's No Trip For Fannie McDaniels: 90-Year-Old Gorham Woman Can't See What Fuss Is All About, She's Used To Travelling To Florida Alone. 'I'm sure I don't know what the fuss is all about,' Mrs. Fannie O. McDaniels, 90-year-old Gorham woman whose hobby is traveling unattended from her summer home on Church Street, Gorham, to points South for the Winter, either New York or Florida, said Friday night as she happily settled herself in the coach seat aboard the State of Maine Express bound for New York. 'I just like to travel and I can get along just as well by myself as with somebody else along, maybe better.' Accompanied to the train by her daughter, Mrs. Lincoln L. Cleaves, of Gorham, Mrs. McDaniels will arrive in Grand Central Station at 7.23 a.m. today, after sitting up all night, to be met by another daughter, Mrs. Ralph P. Stiehl. She will pass the Winter in White Plains with Mrs. Stiehl-that is, unless she has half a chance to go to Florida.  In Florida, Mrs. McDaniels has an opportunity to play shuffleboard. In White Plains she will employ her spare time doing needlework, including knitting, crocheting, tatting and perhaps spinning yarn at a wheel, an accomplishment known now to very few people. The last time she went to Florida was two years ago but the reason for her not going last year was wartime traveling conditions. This year she may get there. Her favorite jaunt, however, was the time she crossed the continent to attend the San Francisco World's Fair, seeing the sights of the whole United States. Mrs. McDaniels, who at 90 has given up making all her own clothes and started wearing the ready-mades, says her daughters 'boss' her-but she says it with a twinkle and Mrs. Cleaves' only answer is 'It certainly looks it, doesn't it?' Dressed in a maroon hat and a black fur-trimmed coat, Mrs. McDaniels caused a good many admiring looks from other passengers. She neither looks nor acts like a nonagenarian-and was pleased with her New Year's corsage of white and yellow chrysanthemums as any 18-year-old. She was convinced, and rightly so, that 'people are just making a fuss over me because I'm 90.' The prospect of a long night sitting up in a coach didn't seem to bother her in the least. She was all set to lean back on the pillow she had brought for the purpose and go right to sleep. sleep. Besides travelling, she is an ardent club member, belonging to the WCTU, Maine Federation of Women's Clubs, Maine Federation of Garden Clubs, Elizabeth Wadsworth Chapter, DAR, Portland Chapters, Daughters of 1812, and First Parish Congregational Church. Formerly a teacher at Waterboro, she has held a one-day session there annually for her former pupils. She was born in Waterboro, living there many years, and took an active part in the community life, particularly in music and choir affairs. At present she has been a full or part-time resident of Gorham for 50 years, where her activities have not yet been curtailed by her age. She may use a cane and speak with a slight quaver, but sunny summer days find her in the garden and in January she is apt to start for anywhere she happens to like, all by herself."</cite> (Portland Press Herald, Saturday Morning, January 5, 1946)

Text of a letter from Geneva McDaniel Stiehl (Fanny McDaniel's daughter) to Ralph M. Cook upon news that his father had died (26 Jun 1945) <cite>"I have heard from you indirectly-from Gorham- and I know you all are now through another hard experience. Your father was certainly a very good father to you. I think he understood so many of your problems and tried to help you. He always said he and you were very close. How nice now to have that to think about. He was certainly a very kind uncle. I have only the most pleasant memories of him and I think of him as he was in his early working days in Boston he was a brave soldier going out each day, working hard for his little family. Now his last days were peaceful and you have been most faithful to him. I [chanced ?] to hear that you are over-working. Must you? I'm afraid you may find it does not pay. I'd love to see you, Laura and Beverly Ann- We should manage a meeting somehow. Much love to you all. Geneva [McDaniel Stiehl] Ralph sends regards and sympathy."</cite>

She married <strong>Lincoln Lewis CLEAVES</strong>, 9 Nov 1922. He was born on 10 Mar 1877. He died on 20 Jan 1940 and was buried in the Eastern Cemetery in Gorham, Cumberland Co. ME. 
<p>
<cite>"Grace was very cultured in her appearance and mannerisms. She drove a snappy looking convertible and wore lovely big hats. She had a very expressive and dramatic face & a deep, deep, voice. I knew her best after she was widowed and returned to Maine to live in her late 50's and 60's. I'm sure she had a busy life as a "New Yorker" when married to Lincoln Cleaves. I saw him only a few times. I loved Grace's antique shop & visited there in Gorham 2 or 3 times each summer. My brother, John, bought and was given many of her things, especially McDaniel items. Our line goes back to Mary Chilton of the 'Mayflower' via the McDaniels. I only wish Grace had written down the information or if she had-she had given it to us. Oh well!"</cite> (Nancy Goddard, her cousin)

HOW THEY MET: <cite>Ruby Mae Breitkreutz Graffunder writes "As for Uncle Ralph, he worked as a salesman for Studebacher Auto Co. in New York City. Why Aunt Laura went to NYC is a mystery to me but that's where she met Uncle Ralph. When Studebacher went out of business, Uncle Ralph ended up in St. Paul working for Montgomery Ward Co. When MW & Co. built a place in Menands, Uncle Ralph was transferred there. I don't really know much more about him. He was a wonderful person with a nice sense of humor and was forever correcting my grammar."</cite> His daughter, Beverly Anne COOK recalls that Ralph and Laura roomed in the same apartment building, with the male and female tenants segregated.
<p>
According to Ruby Mae Breitkreutz Graffunder, Ralph came to work for Montgomery Wards in St. Paul, MN after Studebaker in NY City went out of business in 1924; she also recalls that he left St. Paul for Menands, NY when Montgomery Wards opened its new plant there and offered him a pay raise if he would consent to a transfer.
