Now take the time when I was four yearsold; make it three years old....I was playing in a baby buggy on our farm inLowell. All of a sudden one of the horses came running around the corner of thebarn and saw me lying there and blocking his passage. Being a bright horse, hejumped right over the buggy and left me o.k. but startled!</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anotherfamous Wyss story is about a widow. It seems that this widow came to my fatherAlfred Wyss and was all upset because her son was threatening to commitsuicide. She pleaded with my father to help her talk him aout of this. Dad wentto see her son and sympathized with his problem and offered many goodsuggestions as well as his cooperation in committing a good sucide. Later onthe widow thanked dad profusely for whatever he did sincer her son wasn’tmaking any threats anymore.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Idon’t remember when we moved two miles north of Lowell to Foxes Corners. I doremember watching the Grand Rapida, Saginaw, and Pere Marquette Railroad beingbuilt which happened about the same time. I made up my mind then and there tobe a locomotive engineer.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WhenI first went to school at Foxes Corners, I had a lot of trouble with theEnglish language. My family spoke German Swiss, and my Swiss was better than myEnglish. My first big school trauma started with my man school teacher pickingme to ride to school. He was bringing a bouquet of flowers to school that dayand asked me to hold the bouquet while he drove the horse and buggy. I alwayssaid that I would have rather gone to school without my pants on than to holdthose flowers. The only way out of it was to answer the teasing that I got atschool with my fists!</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soonafter we moved to Foxes Corners, my dad started to work in a water power plantfor a Grand Rapids company. The plant was a mile and a half away over a veryremote road, and I was pretty proud when my mother let me take my dad’s lunchto him all by myself.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Iused to spend a lot of time at the power plant with my dad. It was aspectacular place with great big beveled gears and long leather belts about twoand a half feet wide. I really got acquainted with the place when my father gotan infection in one leg and had to work his shifts on crutches. It issurprising how he could stay on the main floor of the plant and direct me tooperate things in the basement, gear room, and the switchboard.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oneof my favorite things was starting and stopping the turbine pump whichfurnished the City of Lowell with all of its water. A man could stand on thefloor and turn the three foot wheel, but I had to brace my feet against thewall to turn it.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dad’s boss usually had fish poles set out on the boom, and I remember dadlanding nine fish for him in his absence. One time he caught an unusually largepickeral which tried to get away from him out on the boom. There was a wildwrestling match, and dad lost. Soaking wet, he gave his boss the fish but nevermentioned the huge pickeral.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember on one occasion when dad told me to watch things for awhile, so hecould go outside. Suddenly, a group of visitors walked into the power house,and I felt as if I had to do something to show them how important I was. Iboldly walked over to the switchboard, but it read just as it should. Well, Ijust had to turn it to impress the visitors and immediately bells started toclang and my father ran in out of nowhere. I corrected the situationimmediately, and the bells stopped. I don’t think that dad ever knew quite whathappened.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In1904 when I was eight years old, a new power plant was being built upstreamfrom the old one. My father was transferred to the new plant and we moved intoa farmhouse adjacent to the flowage. A gravel pit became flooded and this wasour new swimming hole. I recall that right on my eighth birthday on June 8th, Imade my first venture into the deep water. Feeling bolder, I asked my dad whathe would give me if I dived off the top of the gatehouse out on the dam. Hisanswer was “A good licking”, so I never told him that I had already dived offthe gatehouse.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thinking like a competent swimmer, I accepted when a fisherman asked me to diveinto dangerous water to recover an expensive fishing pole since he promised topay me a quarter. I recovered the rod and reel, and he still owes me thequarter.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anothertime a farmer came along and dared me to jump off the bridge over the canal andpromised me a nickle. The currentwas very strong and swept me way downstream.By the time I got back, the farmer had galloped away with his horses to savethe nickel.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going back to Foxes Corners...One day when no one was home or at the next farm,I saw my chance to climb to the top of the windmill, another forbidden thing. Iclimbed straight to the top and straight into a pile of grease, and wound up byconfessing the whole story to my angry parents.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Iredeemed myself by milking a cow when my parents were gone one evening. Theycame home late and were all concerned about that cow going so long, and I was ahero when I said that I had taken care of the milking.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Onanother occasion I wasn’t such a hero. My Grandpa Bieri was babysitting for meand must have had too much hard cidar.He fell asleep in the chair, dropping hislong Swiss pipe. I, knowing the value of tobacco, didn’t think that it shouldgo to waste, so I started puffing on it. It wasn’t too long before I becamepretty sick. I couldn’t even say that I saved the house from burning downbecause grandpa always had a cover over the pipe bowl.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another farm story...we always kept bees. When bees swarm, you have to have anew hive ready. Well, they swarmed one day when I was home alone. I rememberedsomething about you were supposed to beat some pans together which made thebees hang in a tree or something. Then, I laid a white cloth down in front ofan empty hive, found dad’s wide brimmed hat and net, put on his coat and longpants, tied strings around my wrists and ankles, put on leather gloves, took ascreen trap from the fish pool,and got at least half of the bees where theywere hanging in a tree and dumped them in front of their new home. Everyone waspretty surprised that I could handle the bee situation.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Myfather and mother started to farm on the side. We had two horses,four cows,four calves, and lots of pigs and chickens. We smoked ham and bologna in oursmokehouse and dried peaches and apples in our drying house. My job in theprocess was to keep the fires and smudges going properly. To make the work morepleasant, I used to pretend that I was firing a locomotive on the PereMarquette.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wealso had a corn crib on the place with a corn sheller in it. This became myprivate power house. I rigged up a system of pulleys and belts and had things whirlingall over that corn crib driven by the corn sheller. The spools would whirl sofast that sparks would fly!</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Backin those days, we had potato picking vacations for school kids. I pickedpotatoes for a man named Wells for a penny a bushel, and I remember pickingwhile the snow was falling. Wells used to talk about his brother who would notdrink from a dipper that had been emptied into the kitchen slop pail. In hismind he believed that the germs jumped from the slop pail unto the dipper andcontaminated it forever.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WhenI was eleven, (1907) I worked for a farmer called Lev Lee who lived about twomiles from us. They really got a lot of work out of the kids working on farms.I never plowed, but I could harness a team, operate cultivators, haul wood forthe thrashing machine, milk cows, and of course, clean stables. Working on thefarm wouldn’t have been bad if the hired man that I slept with would havewashed his socks once in awhile. Old Lev was a tough customer and pretty hardon me. I worked there for three months and three weeks that summer and earnedfive dollars a month.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Levwasn’t all bad. He sent me into town on errands one day and told me to enjoythe homecoming festivities while I was there. While I was in a store, I learnedthat there was a baseball game between the All Stars of Grand Rapids and theLumberjacks of Lowell. This was my first sight of baseball uniforms, and I havebeen an avid baseball fan ever since.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PoorLev Lee! When I checked out with him, he was sick in bed. He got tears in hiseyes when I said goodbye. He didn’t last long after that. Either did the farmerwhere I picked potatoes in the fall...</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therewas an old storage shed on this farm that was loaded with old oxen yokes and anold reaper. The outdoor toilet had one newspaper in it with a headline “DEWEYCAPTURES MANILA!” I figured anyone who could remember that far back had to bepretty old.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oneday I was hauling wood as usual for the thresher, bringing it up a winding roadalong a creek to a remote field. As I unloaded the wood, I noticed a hornet’snest in the long grass nearby. When one of those hornets stung me, Iimmediatley decided to get even. After unloading the wood, I ran over thehornet’s nest with the hind wheel of the wagon, figuring the horses and I wouldgallop away fast enough. I was wrong. Those hornets took after us, and I wastrying to hold the horses with one hand and beat off the hornets with theother. What a wild ride! One of the horse jumped over an outside leather tug.Before we got to the farmhouse, I fixed the tug and got the horses settleddown. Everyone sympathized with my hornet bites never knowing that I invited myown trouble.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thatfall my dad was up at Croton Dam where we were going to move when our house wasbuilt. Every Sunday when we went to church, we would say goodbye to all ourfriends and then learn that our house wasn’t ready and then show up again thenext Sunday. It got embarrassing. Meanwhile we had a good crop of apples on ourplace. My sister and I would pick these apples and haul eight crates at a timein our “double buggy” to the cider mill at Lowell where we could get ten centsa bushel. My older brother Otto who was tied down to other duties at the farmand my mother would each get a share of our efforts.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wemade a deal with mother that we could either spend a nickel apiece on ourfavorite caramels or go to the movie house after we made the sale at the cidermill. One day on the way to the mill we were stopped by a man from the canningfactory who offered us twenty-five cents a bushel for the apples. My sister gotthe check for two dollars, and I went to the bank with her to cash it, We werenow pretty affluent business people and my mother thought that it was okay whenwe reported that we went to the show and bought a bag of caramels besides.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whileup at Croton, dad got lonesome for the family, and he wanted someone to comeand visit him. It couldn’t be one of my sisters since they wouldn’t fit in thecommunity boarding house too well. My older brother couldn’t be spared from thefarm, so I became the unmerited pinch hitter. What a thrill to ride the PereMarquette to Grand Rapids and change at Union Station. Dad met me in Newaygowith one of the company teams for the eight mile ride to Croton. He was busy atthe plant that night so I went with him. It sure was an imposing power housewith a forty foot wall to reach the bottom. There was temporary scaffolding upin the skylight seventy feet high. When dad wasn’t looking, I climbed to thetop of the power house to have a look down.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inthe company barn they had a bronco, along with a lot of other horses. During mystay I was allowed to saddle up the bronco whenever I wished. His name wasPeanuts. I had done a lot of horseback riding but I had never ridden in asaddle. Peanuts was a lot rougher than the horses on the farm, but the saddlehelped. I started wishing for a saddle for our farm horses.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fred was my favorite horse at Lowell. One evening I was bringing him in fromthe field when he slid on a manure pile toward a barbed wire fence. Not wantingto drop me into the manure or scratch me on the fence, he threw me over thefence into soft clean grass and took off into the barn on his own.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Iremember the first night that we got Fred. He was pretty nervous in the stable,and I was told to go and kind of settle him down. Fred was startled when I camerunning into the barn and kicked me swiftly in the midsection and left me onthe ground with the wind knocked out of me. We became best friends anywaybecause I knew there was no mean intention.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gettingback to staying at Croton, I found the biggest thrill was riding on thecompany’s private railroad car for five and a half miles from Croton to IrwinJunction. They claim the locomotive used to pull some pretty swanky passengercars on the Michigan Central, and I just loved her.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The food at the company boarding house was just delicious. It was there that Ihad wheat flakes for breakfast for the first time and have enjoyed them eversince. All the men treated me and one another like comrades. It was a realfellowship type atmosphere.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While at Croton, I got to ride on the company’s twenty eight foot launch. Itwas driven by a forty horse power continental engine and the launch cost morethan a high priced automobile did. You cannot imagine the thrill of riding init!</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenwe finally moved to Croton, I got to pilot this launch for a galaxy of wealthypeople from Grand Rapids, Muskegon, and other cities.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway,I was visiting dad at Croton and it was time to go home. I didn’t want to leavesince I was having the time of my life. My father had to get this pioneer onehundred and ten thousand volt power house going so he couldn’t help much withthe move.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To prepare for the move to Croton, mother sold the horses, cows, pigs, farmimplements, wagons, buggies, and harnesses. Uncle John Bieri, our mother’sbrother, took charge of loading our furniture into the box car. He sure did agood job since everything arrived in Croton in good shape. The only problem wasa swarm of bees got loose again in the boxcar and made it darn hard to unload.The chickens were fine and were sent in pens with feed and water according toone of Uncle John’s transportation plans. The bees didn’t bother the chickens.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenwe got to Croton, everyone wondered why we had so many chairs. The explanationis Swiss people have many church meetings in their homes and need chairs forall the visitors.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Idon’t want to leave Lowell without commenting on my older brother, Otto, whodied of appendicitis shortly after we left Lowell. He seemed to be sort of ayoung Edison, having built electric motors, electric heaters, and all kinds ofmechanical devices. He used to go around trading his inventions for cameras,guns, and whatever he needed. He could load his own shotgun shells and was anexceptional photographer in his day, developing his plates and having his owndark room. Years later, met a classmate of Otto’s at a golf course in Pontiac.He told me that Otto used to repair all of the broken laboratory equipment atthe high school when he was in ninth grade.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ottowas good in school and so was my cousin, I thought. This girl was on her way tohigh school in Lowell and I saw that she had library books. I ran home and toldmy mother that my cousin was so good in school that she now had to get booksfrom the library since she mastered all the books in the school.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wewere living in Croton where John Seastrom and Charlie Harger were theoperators. They worked twelve hour shifts, six days a week. One of the linemanwas to fill in at the plant two days a week so my father as the managerwouldn’t have any shift work. However, my dad didn’t think that this linemanwould be a good operator so he took the shifts himself.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lineman in question was a wonderful baseball player and used to play on aGrand Rapids team before moving to Croton. He used to pick up extra money bypitching in some towns on Sundays.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, one Sunday the Stanwood ball team, sixteen miles away wanted him to pitchfor them in a very critical game. Unfortunately he could not get permission forthe day off from the dispatcher in Grand Rapids. Strangely enough, on theSunday of the game, the company’s private telephone line near Stanwood shortedout. The lineman, of course, had to take his team of horses to Stanwood to findout the trouble. After he fixed it, he had to rest the horses so he saw nothingwrong with pitching in the Stanwood game before returning to the plant.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Menworking at the plant wore blue overalls, blue jackets, and shop caps.

One day one of the company executives had a party of people out in thelaunch and the motor went dead. I looked at the launch and saw that it wasmoving toward the dam. The bear trap gate was open and created a falls of fortyfeet wide and five feet deep. I ran into the plant to close the gate whichwasn’t easy because it was slow and heavy moving. By the time the gate wasclosed, the launch had floated right up to the falls. They got the launch goingagain and started away never knowing how close they came to tragedy. Nothingwas ever said about this incident that I remember. I don’t think that anyoneelse knew.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Iloved to work with my dad around the powerhouse and dam. It was much more funthan tending animals in the barn or doing garden chores. Dad needed to make animprovement to the powerhouse crane. The crane had such a slow moving hook forsmall loads that had to be dropped down into the powerhouse that dad decided toput a cable on the crane drum which would be twenty times as fast as thestandard crane. This required some slow drilling with a rachet drill at 65 feetabove the powerhouse floor, and I got to do the drilling. Dad never seemed toworry about my climbing all over the powerhouse. Heights didn’t mean a thing tohim and he took it for granted that I was the same way.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fishingwas great in the Muskegon River in those days. Many people drove by horse andbuggy to see the new dam and backwater. Once there, many people got the urge tofish and inquiry would show that I had fish poles equipped with lines and hooksfor rent. I was also the person to see to purchase live bait. I was also theone who rented boats and I could arrange stable space where horses could be fedand watered. Furthermore, if people had no picnic lunch, I could furnish thatalong with hot coffee since my mother was glad for a little spending money too.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fishermanwho fish and do not catch anything can be pretty depressed. Noting this, I kepta live box of bass in the company boat house. I would give the unluckyfisherman a net and he could dip live fish right out of the box. Since it wasunlawful to sell black bass, I just considered my proceeds as tips.

From Stanton I got back on my bike and rode four miles tovisit the Krumms. They had a boy a year or two older than I.

I faced the situationand made a decision . I explained that I was off to Lowell the next day tovisit relatives and no extra clothes to ruin in a fight and furthermore,arriving in Lowell with my face all marked up would upset my relatives andspoil the visit. I admitted that it was too bad that I couldn’t fight this timesince it would certainly be a good match and all of the onlookers would enjoyit too, but I just couldn’t entertain at this time.

Uncle John quick putme to work, tying a leather apron around me while explaining that its owner haddied a few days ago.

Always one to like a challenge, I decidedto try it. Everything went fine until I hit the water, damaging my arm. Atleast I made it.

One Saturday I was given the horse and buggy and assigned the job oftraveling around the countryside to tell people that labor was needed to tearout these tracks. By noon I had fed and watered the horse at the country storenorth of Croton and bought myself some lunch. My day as an employment agentturned out real good since lots of men showed up to tear out of the track.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somepower company men from Grand Rapids came up with the idea of using the companylocomotive which had formerly been used on the construction of the dam. Theysteamed up the old Michigan Central passenger locomotive but couldn’t get anyfurther than outside the roundhouse. My dad couldn’t figure out why they didn’ttake his advice and hire the former fireman of the locomotive since he livednearby. Gibbard was the name of the former fireman. They finally decided tohire a Pere Marquette locomotive while ripping out the tracks. This locomotivehad to go to Baldwin, Michigan every night to fill out with water and coal. A minimumcrew was a fireman, an engineer, and a conductor,</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was in seventh grade and the foreman of the crew invited me to ride on thetrain on a certain Saturday. I looked forward to this and was on hand brightand early on Saturday morning. As I was boarding, the conductor (rightfully so)wouldn’t let me board because I was not part of the crew involved in the trackremoval. The foreman argued in my favor, but the conductor would not back down.John Seastrom, the operator who was on shift at Croton that morning, found mecrying my eyes out down below the powerhouse. He tried to comfort me butnothing helped.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then a strange thing happened. The foreman made arrangements with my father andthe school to hire me for a few weeks as the water boy on his crew, so here Iwas riding the train for the next two weeks and getting a dollar a day fordoing it.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thespring of 1910, my last one at Croton, seemed to find things rather dull. Itook my bicycle to Grant one day to look for a job. Grant was a rich farmingcommunity, and I called on a lot of farms that didn’t need any help. Finally, Istopped at the Neil farm where they told me that they could use me duringhaying season. This was quite a pretentious farm with a big brick residence andsix hands. They agreed to pay me seventy-five cents a day. Harvesting handswere not supposed to have to do any milking. but I noticed that Mrs. Neil hadto do all the milking alone so I decided to help her out. She was not the kindof woman who appreciated this. In fact, she was pretty severe. One day I had anaccident with the windmill which I was able to correct, but she really gave mehell for it, so helping with the milking never made her fond of me.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Idid distinguish myself with Mr. Neil. The pulley system up in the barn neededrepair but Neil or any of his men would not dare to climb to the peak of thebarn. This was no trick for me after climbing all over the Croton powerhouse.There was just enough equipment on the farm to make harvesting fun. Hay rakeslifted the hay and grain for easy loading. Horses were used to lift all theproducts up to the mows of the barn.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TheNeils had a daughter who was quite a young lady. She was a milliner in Cadillacwho was spending her summer on the farm. Apparently, she was not interested inthe other farm hands, but she and I appeared talk the same language. She wantedme to tell her about the people that I had met in Grand Rapids and Muskegon andespecially about their automobiles. Now, the front porch of the Neil home wasquite isolated from the rest of the house and was equipped with a hammock. Thehammock was the only furniture on the porch. One evening we were visiting onthe porch when she told me that I might as well lay down on the hammock withher since there was plenty of room. We had a good night’s sleep and wereastonished to find ourselves still there as dawn was breaking. We both tiptoedto our rooms upstairs. I had no more than rolled into bed with the hired manwhen I was called to get up. It is a good thing that old Mrs. Neil did not hearabout this.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oneof my other part-time jobs while living at Croton included driving people fromCroton to Newaygo and back using the company horses. In fact, there was hardlya job that I wouldn’t tackle. I took out a contract with a widow to saw down anold shed and cut the wood into fire size pieces for a lump sum. </span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anothersummer job was for the power company. My dad had hired a painter to do thewaste gate on the dam, and I was supposed to do the scraping ahead of him.Looking at Croton Dam today, I can’t believe that I was scrambling all overthose gates scraping paint with a drop of forty feet beneath me.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thepainter, Darias Bartron, made a real impression on me.

There was a rumor that lumber and otherconstruction equipment left over from Croton Dam was going to be towed to thehead of the pond where the Oxbow Dam would be built. I had visions of runningthe company motorboat to do the hauling. It is a good thing that I didn’t stakemy future on this plant since it wasn’t built until I was thirty four years oldand was named Hardy Dam.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well,on June 8, 1911 I turned fifteen and a few days later I took a train to theeastern side of the state to work on the tower line between East Tawas andCooks Dam on the Au Sable River. While riding along on the train, a grown mannext to me asked me where I was headed. I explained about my job and he told methat a kid my age couldn’t make it in tower line construction. This reallydiscouraged me, but out of the window, I saw Lake Huron, the first body ofwater where I couldn’t see the other side. It got my mind off my doubts.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thatnight I slept in a nice, comfortable farm house four miles north of East Tawas.The next morning I was assembling steel tower anchors.

One look around and I knew that I couldn’t eat there, so I went back tothe tents and lived on raw oatmeal and cheese for three meals a day until therest of the men returned. On the second day I was on my fifth meal of oatmealand cheese when a farmer happened by. He wormed the story out of me and madearrangements for me to have a good meal at his house while he guarded the camp.His daughter who was his housekeeper also invited me for supper and forbreakfast the next day. They were real nice people, and I always wished that Iwould have written down their name so I could have sent them some special tokenof appreciation.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatmy job with the crew really was was chore boy. I started the kitchen fire earlyin the morning, set the table, waited on tables, washed dishes, cut upvegetables, split wood, carried logs, and made beds. As the crew increased toforty four men, it seemed that I didn’t even have a chance to write a letterhome. I worked from 5 a.m. to 8 p.m. without a break. Once in awhile, one ofthe men would help me with the dishes at night, so I could join in a game ofcatch later.</span></p><p class=Body style='line-height:24.0pt;tab-stops:.5in 1.0in'><spanstyle='font-family:"Courier New";vertical-align:super'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thecook, who was my boss, was an older fellow who had been disappointed in lovewhen he was a young man living in Canada.

You could have all the coffee that you wanted for breakfastand a choice of coffee or tea at the other meals. The men were allowedunlimited eggs and pancakes.
