According to tradition, the Eligood Mills Bible was first owned by 3. Eligood Mills Sr. (1744-1832), and may have been purchased as early as 1819. From Eligood, it passed on from his grandson, 37. James Mills (by his son 9. William Mills). James Mills in turn passed it on to his daughter, 105. Fanny nee Mills McDaniel (1855-1949). She in turn passed it on to her nephew (by her sister 106. Mary Elizabeth nee Mills Cook), 156. Ralph Mills Cook (1894-1960). It is currently in the possession of one of Ralph Mills Cook’s grandsons.
<p>
There are apparently several different authors of the inscriptions included within the bible, which can be noted both by their handwriting and the use of different colored inks. (James Mills identifies himself as one. Fanny nee Mills McDaniel is the most likely person to have introduced annotations referring to published genealogical articles.) A few pages are loose and have placed at the end of the transcript. What follows are a series of scanned images. (Higher resolution scans are available on request.)
