His first muster roll card for Jan-Feb 1863 identifies him as being stationed at Adams Run; his muster roll cards for Mar-Apr and May-Jun 1863 identify him as being on detached duty, which suggests but does not imply he saw action with his unit. The unit was ordered to Wilmington in March of 1863 and served in that time before returning to Adams Run; the unit then left by rail on 4 May of 1863 from Charleston, SC to Jackson, MS, near Vicksburg. The unit was transferred to the command of General Statesrights Gist's brigade on 4 Jul 1863 after the fall of Vicksburg and transferred to Rome, GA. His muster roll card for Jul-Aug identifies him as a "Drummer -Extra on Daily duty - Transferred to the Band, Aug 31/63."
