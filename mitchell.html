This is a genealogy of a Mitchell family that migrated from Portsea, England to Wilmington, New Hanover Co. North Carolina.<p>

<p>
<a name="one"><strong>1. Thomas<sup>1</sup> Mitchell</strong>. He was born in England ca. 1798-1800 according to census records and his obituary. (An entry in the Thomas Bible (below) suggests he was born in London ca. 1792. If the obituary is accurate, he may be the Thomas Mitchell, son of Thomas and Mary Mitchell born 20 May 1798 and baptized 20 Oct 1799 at St. Mary's, Portsea, Hampshire, England.)  He died on 20 Sep 1871 in Wilmington, New Hanover Co. NC and was buried on 21 Sep 1871 in Section J, Lot 45 Oakdale Cemetery, Wilmington, New Hanover Co. NC. In various records he is referred to as a laborer, a brewer, a hat presser, a fisherman, and a farmer.
<p>
Thomas married <strong>Eliza LININGTON </strong>, daughter of Thomas and Ann nee Mew Linington, on 10 Jul 1821 at St. Mary's, Portsea, Hampshire Co. England. (LDS M062613). She was born on 12 Jul 1798 on the Isle Of Wight, England. (Census entries and her obit consistently refer to her as being born ca. 1798, exact date of birth calculated from her obituary.) She was baptized on 26 Dec 1798 at Newport, Isle of Wight, England. She died on 8 Oct 1862 in Wilmington, New Hanover Co. NC. Here is a photograph of <a href="temitchell.html">Thomas and Eliza nee Linnington MITCHELL</a>.
<p>
<i>"I. Thomas Mitchell born in London 1792 married Liza Linnington born in London 1795"</i>(Entry from the Thomas Bible)
<p>
Thomas and Eliza lived in the vicinity of Portsmouth, Hampshire, England until at least 17 Apr 1836, as indicated by christening records of multiple children. They then migrated to Ingorville, France (near Le Havre) as indicated by christening records for two of their children.
<p>
Thomas and his family migrated from Le Havre, France to New York, New York, United States of America on 5 Aug 1848 aboard the ship Albany (Passenger Lists of Vessels Arriving at New York, New York, 1820-1897 Year 1848, M237-74; Line 7, list no 859, Page no. 4.). Thomas "Mitschell" [sic] (49 yrs old) is accompanied by his wife Eliza (49 yrs old), daughter Caroline (22 yrs old), daughter Eliza (16 yrs old), son William (14 yrs old), son Charles (12 yrs old), son Henry (8 years old) and daughter Blanche (6 months old).  All passengers on the ship are identified as farmers from Bavaria who intend to reside in Michigan.
<p>
Thomas and his family appear in the 1850 census for King County in New York City, which was taken in  July 1950. 
<p>
CENSUS RECORDS: 1850<em>- Thomas Mitchell (50 years old, Hat presser born in England), his wife Eliza (52, born in England), and children Caroline (23, born in England), Eliza (18, born in England), Wm. (16, "Paper boy man", born in England), Charles (14, born in England), Henry (12, born in France), Charles (1, born in New York).</em> (1850 census for the 10th ward, King County, New York, USA) 
<p>
This strongly suggests a naturalization record for Thomas Mitchell filed in the City Court of Brooklyn, NY on 19 Oct 1850 refers to him:
<p>
NATURALIZATION RECORD: <em>"In City Court of Brooklyn. State of New York, Kings County, City of Brooklyn. SS, I Thomas Mitchell Do declare on oath, that it is my intention to become a Citizen of the United States; and so renounce for ever all allegiance  and fidelity to any Foreign Prince, Potentate, State or Sovereignty whatever; and particularly to the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Sworn in open Court, this 19th day of October 1850 Thomas Mitchell..."</em> (North Carolina Naturalization Records (Camin) - Thomas Mitchell New Hanover County 1850. Citizenship and Naturalization Records 1850-1853 New Hanover Co. CR 070 902.1) 
<p>
Thomas and Eliza's obituaries both suggest they migrated shortly after the census to Wilmington (Wrightsville Sound), New Hanover Co. NC, perhaps as early as 1852. In any event, they appear in the 1860 census.
<p>
CENSUS RECORDS: 1860<em>- Thomas Mitchell and his wife Eliza are listed in the 1860 census for Wilmington, New Hanover Co. NC living next door to John Rudge (his son-in law)'s family. In this entry he is identified as a fisherman.</em> (1860 census for Wrightsville Sound, New Hanover Co. NC)

<a name="two"><strong>2. Louisa<sup>2</sup> MITCHELL</strong> (<a href="#one">Thomas</a><sup>1</sup>). Louisa was born on 8 Jan 1822 in Portsmouth, Hampshire, England and was baptized on 3 Mar 1822 at St. Marys, Portsea, Hampshire, England. She died after three days of paralysis on 2 May 1907 at her home on 613 Baynard St., Savannah, Chatham Co., GA and was buried at 4:30 pm on 3 May 1907 in the Laural Grove Cemetery, Savannah, Chatham Co., GA. Here are five photographs of <a href="lmitchell.html">Louisa nee Mitchell RUDGE</a>.
<p>
She married <strong>John RUDGE</strong>, son of William and Hannah nee Taylor RUDGE, on 9 Nov 1842 in the Parish Church, West Ham, Essex Co., England. John was born on 7 Apr 1822 in West Ham (according to his son's record of birth), Essex Co. England. He was baptized on 12 May 1822 at St. George The Martyr, Southwark, Surrey. He died of yellow fever on 30 Dec 1860 in Wilmington, New Hanover Co. NC, and was buried on 31 Dec 1860 in the Public Ground, Oakdale Cemetery, Wilmington, New Hanover Co. NC. His marriage and also his son's record of birth refer to him as an "engineer". Here's a <A HREF="c6-3.html">photograph</a> of John and Louisa nee Mitchell Rudge. Information about John's parentage and their descendants is located <a href="rudge.html">here</a>.
<p>
RECORD OF MARRIAGE: <cite>"[Year] 1842. Marriage solemnized at the Parish Church in the Parish of Westham in the County of Essex. No. 268 [When Married] November 9; [Name and Surname] John Rudge [and] Louisa Mitchell; [Age] Full Age, Full age [Condition] Bachelor, Spinster; [Rank or Profession] Engineer, (none listed); [Residence at the Time of Marriage] Westham, Westham; [Father's Name and Surname] William Rudge Deceased, Thomas Mitchell; [Rank or Profession of Father] Engineer, Brewer. Married in the Parish Church according to the Rites and Ceremonies of the Established Church, After Banns by me, R. H. Howard. This Marriage was solemnized between us, John Rudge [and] Louisa Mitchell, in the Presence of us, Thomas Adams and Hannah Adams."</cite> 
<p>
Louisa and her husband John lived in St. George in the East, Middlesex England for a short time and then migrated to Le Havre, Seine Maritime, France, where according to tradition (referred to by Kenneth Rudge Wilson Jones) John worked on the rebuilding and repair of the port. There is a record of their son John William's birth in Le Havre, Seine Maritime, and also their daughter Mary Louisa's birth in Nantes, Loire Atlantique, France. (The latter record suggests John was not present at the birth of his youngest daughter.) 
<p>
Baptism records for their first three children suggest that John and Louisa migrated to Le Havre, Seine Maritime, France shortly after their marriage with several other members of their family, including John's older brothers William and Edward, his older sister Sarah Elizabeth nee Rudge Pollington, their families and Louisa's parents, Thomas and Eliza Mitchell. They returned to the parish of St. George in the East, Middlesex, England, as witnessed by records of the deaths of two of their children, and then returned to Le Havre, where according to tradition (referred to by Kenneth Rudge Wilson Jones) John worked on the rebuilding and repair of the port. There is a record of his son John William's birth in Le Havre, Seine Maritime, and also their daughter Mary Louisa's birth in Nantes, Loire Atlantique, France (noted below). The family appears in the 1851 census for Nantes.
<p>
A "laving up list" (reference 120j27292) of the crew of the steamboat "La Bretagne", which was built in Le Havre in 1843 and engaged in offshore coastal traffic between Nantes and Lisbon under Captain Blanchent refers to John as follows: <i>Left from the port of Nantes on 29 May 1854 and returned on 14 August 1854, John Rudge, chief mechanic, living in Nantes, born in Great Britain, age 39 years old, Hair and eyebrows blond, high forehead, ordinary nose, middle mouth, heavy chin and oval face. Wages 250 francs per month."</i>
<p>
<cite>"As you already know our great grandfather (your great great) John William Rudge was born in Le Havre, (France) while his father was engaged as an engineer in the rebuilding of the port. I have a daguerreotype of him and his older brother Thomas taken there, probably in about 1852-1855. I also recall that when they entered this country they came to Philadelphia first, then Savannah. There may be records of entry there in the immigration office. Mamma Carrie (my grandmother) and Aunt Kate always kept little bits of French phrases that they used to hear as children from this episode."</cite> (letter from Kenneth Rudge Wilson Jones to David Rudge 20 Mar 1983)

<p>
<cite>A descendant, William Jerome Rudge Jr. claimed that the early Rudges, like other immigrants, were trying to get away from poor economic conditions, "crooks and robbers" from England, outcasts who came for a new start. His daughter in law, Beverly Anne Cook Rudge, distinctly remembers him telling about the family's immigration from England. Someone was carrying a little boy up a gang plank  The boy fell into the ocean and was fished out by someone, thus ensuring the Rudges made it to America."</cite>
<p>
I have located an immigration record that appears to refer to our John Rudge and his family. They arrived at the port of New York on 6 Nov 1858 aboard the ship Wm. Frothingham, which set sail from Le Havre. On the ship's manifest are listed John Rudge (age 36), Louise Rudge (age 36), Mary Rudge (age 8) and John Rudge (age 6). An image of this immigration record is located <a href="immigration.html">here</a>.
<p>
John and his family appear in the 1860 census for Wrightsville Sound (Wilmington), New Hanover Co. NC taken in August next to his in-laws, Thomas and Eliza nee LINNINGTON MITCHELL. John and his wife are both listed as 38 years old and born in England; his son John William and daughter Mary Louise are listed as 11 and 9 years old respectively, both born in France.
<p>
OBITUARY: <cite>"In this town, on the morning of the 30th inst., Mr. JOHN RUDGE, aged 38 years and 9 months. The friends and acquaintances of the family are invited to attend the funeral, from his late residence on Second street (next door to Wm. Mitchell's), at 3 o'clock this afternoon, 31st inst."</cite> The Daily Journal, Wilmington, N. C. Monday December 31, 1860, v. 10, no. 97, whole number 2867, p. 3. (Essentially the same obituary appears in The Wilmington Daily Herald, Wilmington, N. C. for Monday December 31, 1860 and also The Wilmington Journal, 3 Jan 1861, v. 17, no. 19.)
<p>
After the death of her husband (ca 1860-61) Louisa and her children migrated to Columbia, Richland Co. SC , where, according to an application for membership into the United Daughters of the Confederacy written by her granddaughter (Kate Irma Rudge) transcribed below under the entry for her son, <a href="#ten">John William</a>, ran away from home to join the Confederacy. Why she moved to Columbia and what she did during the Civil War are unclear, but in any event she and her daughter Mary Louise returned to Wilmington shortly thereafter where they reunited with her son. 
<p>
CITY DIRECTORY: <cite>"Rudge, L. Rudge res. s. w. cor. Market & 7th"</cite> (William H. Bernard's Wilmington and Fayetteville Directory 1866-'7, p. 96.)
<p>
On 18 Aug 1866, Louisa and her two surviving children were received by the Grace Methodist Episcopal Church, also known as the Front Street Station M.E. Church South, in Wilmington, New Hanover Co. NC "on profession of faith in Christ." She is also mentioned as a member on a list of church members dated Nov 1869 and 1870, the latter mentioning that she and her daughter were "removed by certificate in Feb 1873".  
<p>
Louisa moved in with her daughter's (Mary Louise RUDGE (BANKS)) family in Wilmington, New Hanover Co., NC (1870 census), where she is referred to as "Louisa Roger" age 48. They migrated south ca. 1870-71 by way of Baxley, Appling Co., GA (1880 census), ultimately ending up in Savannah, Chatham Co. GA. Louisa appears as a separate entry in several Savannah City directories (1883, 1884, 1893, 1894, 1896-1906), most of which refer to her as the widow of J. Rudge. According to the 1883 and 1884 Savannah city directories, Louisa worked as a housekeeper for a hotel called Screvens House.[Home of commercial travel on Johnson Square. Rooms were $2.00-3.00 per night.] Louisa apparently moved around a great deal within the city, as almost no two entries in these directories give the same address. She curiously does not appear in the soundex index for the 1900 census for Savannah.

NEWSPAPER ARTICLE DETAILING AN INTERVIEW SHE HAD: <cite>"FORTUNE GOES BEGGING. A SAVANNAH LADY THE SUPPOSED HEIRESS TO $100,000. Mrs. Rudge, Formerly of England, Sought for by Chancery Attorneys With an Estate to Dispose of - A Slight Difference in Names and Localities All That Stands in the Way of Her Assuming the Property - A Chat With Mrs. Rudge. EKINS-RUDGE-MRS. RUDGE, FORMERLY of Great Barford, Bedfordshire, England, (nee Ekins), if living, or her children if dead, may bear of something to her advantage by applying to PATTISON, WIGG & KING, solicitors, 11 Queen Victoria st., London, or to J. ARTHUR BARRATT, Consellor [sic] -at-Law, 11 Pine st., New York. This advertisement appeared in Sunday's New York <i>Herald</i>. The <i>Herald</i>, in commenting upon it says: It appears from the information imparted by Mr. Barratt to a Herald reporter that Mrs. Rudge, whose maiden name was Ekins, accompanied her husband to Canada about twenty years ago, and subsequently coming with him to this country, settled down either at Washington or somewhere in the neighborhood. Since then nothing has been heard of Mrs. Rudge by her relatives, and she is now being sought in order that she may claim her share of an estate left by a bachelor relative. This relative died about twenty-five years ago, and his estate got into chancery. After a great number of years had passed, a settlement was effected, not, however, before the estate had been well taxed for legal expenses. The money has since been distributed among the family, and Mrs. Rudge is entitled to her share- a quite considerable one if she can furnish the proper proofs of her identity. Mr. Barratt represents the London solicitors and will conduct an examination of all claimants that present themselves in this city. If the proofs are satisfactory the property will be transferred to the claimants. MRS. RUDGE IN SAVANNAH. The name of Rudge is by no means a common one, and friends of Mrs. Louisa Rudge, of No. 32 Henry street, in this city, believe that the description is imperfect and that it refers to Mrs. Rudge, of Savannah. A MORNING NEWS reporter had a very pleasant interview with Mrs. Rudge yesterday at the residence of her daughter, Mrs. John Banks. She is a typical English lady of 67 years, with hair white as the driven snow, but it is no index of her vigor, for in conversation and carriage she seems ten years younger. Mrs. Rudge says that her attention was called to the Herald advertisement and comments by a family friend, Mr. H. C. Houston. She was not prepared to believe that she was the person referred to for two reasons. One is that her maiden name was Mitchell, and second, that she never resided in Canada. It was true, however, that she had relatives in England, and there were proceedings in chancery by relatives of her husband before he died. That, however, was in Staffordshire, and not in Great Barford. A NEIGHBOR OF CHARLES DICKENS. Mrs. Rudge was the daughter of Thomas Mitchell, and her husband's father was William Rudge, a famous engineer. Charles Dickens, she says, lived right across from the old place of the Rudges, and the name of a leading character in one of the great novelist's works she thinks may have been suggested by that fact. She says she married John Rudge Nov. 9, 1842, and showed the certificate of the Parish Clerk, which sets forth that John Rudge and Louisa Mitchell were united in marriage on that date in the parish church of West Ham, Essex county. Her husband was also a celebrated engineer, and the couple resided in Spain, France and Italy, and in October, 1858, emigrated to this country, settling at Wilmington, NC. Her father had come over from England six years before, and owned a watering place near Wilmington which he named Masonboro Sound, but the people called it Mitchell's Sound. The husband of Mrs. Rudge contracted a violent cold, which brought on consumption, from which he died Dec. 30, 1860. MOVED TO SAVANNAH. Mrs. Rudge moved to Savannah in June 1871, where she has since resided. She has two children, Mrs. John Banks, wife of the carpenter of that name, with whom she resides, and one son, John William Rudge, living in Richmond, Va. She has a sister living in Savannah, Mrs. Eliza Hazelton, wife of Samuel J. Hazelton, the carpenter, on Montgomery street, who has three daughters. While Mrs. Rudge does not feel warranted in affirming that she is the person advertised for, she is free to say that there may be property coming from both sides of the family tree, the Rudges and the Mitchells. She intends communicating at an early date with the London and New York lawyers whose names are given in the advertisement, and is prepared by the best documentary evidence to establish her connection by blood and legal marriage with the Rudges and Mitchells of England. Mrs. Rudge is an intelligent lady, of pleasing address, refined by education and travel, and her friends in this city, who are many, sincerely hope that she will come into a rich legacy. It is understood that the amount awaiting the right Mrs. Rudge is in the neighborhood of $100,000." </cite>(30 Mar 1899 Morning News (Savannah, GA) p. 9)

BIOGRAPHY: <em>"Charles K. Farmer. Charles K. Farmer, of Benton Harbor, and purser of the steamer City of Chicago, was born in the city of Brooklyn, N. Y., November 25, 1861. His parents were Francis V. and Sarah (Van Ness) Farmer, natives of New Jersey, the father of New Brunswick and the mother of Pompton. The father is now a retired businessman of New York City, having been in his earlier life a wholesale grocer, and later a manufacturer. The mother has been dead some ten years. Our subject's boyhood was passed in his native city, where he was graduated at the public schools at the age of sixteen years. After his graduation he went into the employ of the Butterick Publishing Company, of New York City, and remained in their employ two years. He next went with the Anchor Line Steamship Company; first as bill of lading clerk, having in charge the rate department, and quoting rates all over the world. Later he was made custom house clerk and boarding officer in the same company's employ. After having served in these positions for a period of seven years, he was compelled, owing to ill health, to sever his connection with the company, and he then began traveling on the road for the firm of Courtenay & Trull, of New York, City, selling railroad, electric light and telegraph supplies. He remained with this company three years, when he was placed in charge of the New York office of the Leatheroid Manufacturing Company, which position he very acceptably filled for three years, but on account of ill-health he was again forced to make a change in business, and he decided to leave the city and go west, and so moved to the State of Michigan, locating at Hartman, where he opened a general store, and through an agreement previously made with the Cincinnati, Wabash & Michigan Railroad Co. (now the Michigan division of the Big Four railroad), by which they were to erect a depot at that point (there being none), and he to act as their agent one year without compensation. He, in connection with his own business, served in the capacity of agent five years. During his residence here he was not only instrumental in establishing a station, but through his efforts a post office was given to Hartman, and the second year of his residence in the place Mr. Farmer was chosen township clerk, and for two terms he served the people as supervisor of the township. Our subject, in 1892, removed to Indianapolis, Ind., where, for one year, he was engaged in the fruit and produce commission business. He withdrew from this to accept the position as editor and manager of the National and State League News published in that city, and after conducting the paper for nearly a year, resigned and accepted a position on special work on the Indianapolis Journal. During the Grand Army Encampment in that city he was detailed to write up a special naval matter (the Naval Veterans Association holding their encampment there at the same time), and had his headquarters on a full-sized model of the old man-of-war Kearsarge, which was erected on the Statehouse grounds, Mr. Farmer having been selected to do the work, owing to the experience he had had and acquaintance with marine and naval matters while in New York City. Possessed of a delicate constitution, and from thorough overwork at the encampment, he was taken sick with nervous exhaustion, and was confined to his room for three months. After again getting out and about he thought best to make a change, and so, in the year 1893, he removed to Benton Harbor, Mich. In the following spring (1894) he accepted the position as agent of the Seymour Transportation Company, which ran a line of steamers between Chicago, St. Joseph and Benton Harbor. The following year he was made superintendent of the line, and continued in that position until the line was discontinued. In March, 1896, he was engaged by the Graham & Morton Transportation Co., for special work, but, they not having any one to fill the position of purser, he was pressed into the service. On September 25, 1883, our subject was married to Miss Athenaise Mitchell, of Brooklyn, N. Y., a daughter of William Mitchell, of Wilmington, N. C., whose wife is Mary (La Grave) Mitchell, of Rochelle, France. To our subject and wife have been born three children-one daughter that died in infancy; Marie, aged ten years; and Louisa, born August 25, 1897. There was one period in Mr. Farmer's life when his ill health was a blessing in disguise, for he had made application, which was accepted, for the Jeneatte Expedition to the North Pole, but owing to his physical condition he had to withdraw his name. Mr. Farmer is a bright and capable business man, and a most genial and accommodating purser."</em> (History of the Great Lakes, v. 2) [http://www.maritimehistoryofthegreatlakes.ca/documents/hgl2/default.asp?ID=s364]

OBITUARY: <em>"Charles K. Farmer, 'Daddy' Of Naval Reserves, Dies. Charles K. Farmer, former Benton Harbor postmaster, founder of the twin city Naval Reserves, and for decades one of Benton Harbor's leading citizens, died at 12:25 Friday afternoon in a veterans' hospital in Bath, NY. He was 79 years old. Mr. Farmer had been in ill health for several years, and entered the eastern hospital in 1934. Word of his death was received here yesterday afternoon, and saddened a meeting of the Benton Harbor post No. 105, American Legion, which paused in its celebration of the 21st anniversary of that organization to pay tribute to the "daddy" of the twin city Naval Reserves. Mr. Farmer is mourned in the twin cities by scores of friends and associates who knew him as a Navy man, a postmaster, civic minded citizen, and business man. Mr. Farmer's life in Benton Harbor spanned the years of the town's growth from a small village to the thriving city it had become when he retired about 1925 from active participation in business and civic affairs. Came Here as a Young Man. He was born November 25, 1861, at Brooklyn, N.Y., and came to Benton Harbor as a young man. During the early years of his career here he was engaged in the drug and real estate businesses, and at one time was connected to the old Graham & Morton steamship lines. He received the appointment to postmaster of Benton Harbor during the administration of William H. Taft, and assumed the office on February 10, 1910, serving until March 1, 1914, when a Democratic administration under President Wilson named his successor. Organized Naval Reserves. Many years before the outbreak of the World war Mr. Farmer was a prime mover in the formation of the fourth division of the Naval Reserves here, and he commanded the twin city unit until the United States entered the conflict. Mr. Farmer answered the call to service with the rank of captain, and was first concerned with developing several divisions of Naval Reserves in the twin city area which were sent into active service. Later in 1917 he was assigned to duty at the Great Lakes Naval station near Chicago, and subsequently he was sent to the Key West, Fla. station, where he was to command for two years. Following the war, Mr. Farmer returned to Benton Harbor, where he remained active for several years, but in later years spent some time in Pennsylvania. His visits east were never prolonged, however, and he often declared that he could not remain permanently away from Benton Harbor. One of the happiest days of his life came in 1926, when, after a visit to Pennsylvania, he returned to view the fine new Naval armory in Benton Harbor for the first time and expressed his great pleasure that "his boys" had such a magnificent building. A major portion of the Navy Day observance of October 27, 1938 was dedicated to Mr. Farmer, and a part of that tribute was the moulding of a bronze bas relief of the veteran's head, which was later mounted at the Naval Reserve armory. Mr. Farmer is survived by two daughters, Mrs. Marie Smith of Grand Rapids, and Mrs. J. A. Jefford, of Oak Park, Ill. Funeral Tuesday. He was a lifelong member of the Knights Templar of the Masonic order and that organization will take part in the funeral services, together with the present Naval Reserve organization at 3 p.m. Tuesday at the Benton Harbor Congregational church, the Rev. Howard A. Bienning will conduct the service. The body will be brought to Benton Harbor from Bath, N.Y. today and friends will be received Sunday and until 11 a.m. Tuesday at the Dean mortuary."</em> (16 Mar 1940 The Herald-Press (Saint Joseph, MI) p. 2)
