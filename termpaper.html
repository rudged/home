<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>DESCRIPTION:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your
assignment is to write a 5 part research paper discussing a scientific concept
or process of your choosing that is regarded as something anyone who is
scientifically literate should know. You will first write a proposal that
identifies the concept you have chosen for approval by your instructor. Once it
is approved, <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Part One</b> of your paper
will explain the concept at a level a reasonably intelligent person who does
not major in the science could understand and identify (on the basis of
independent research) common misconceptions student have with that concept. <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Part Two</b> will present an argument for
why a scientifically literate person must know that concept. <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Part Three</b> will offer an assessment
instrument you could use in your classroom to determine whether your students
are proficient in this concept. <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Part
Four</b> will describe a unit plan for how you would teach the concept with a
specific audience in mind, with at least one example of a lesson within the
unit. Finally <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Part Five</b> will present
an argument for why your instruction, as summarized in Part Four, will
facilitate student learning of the concept.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Photos and illustrations are
encouraged, but not necessary. As indicated in the example, use a 10 point Times
(or Times New Roman) font and double-space throughout. <u>For each part, be
sure to provide references for any sources you consult (e.g. websites, biology
books) for any information that is not considered common knowledge</u>.
Examples of each of these elements </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>will be made available to you by
your instructor.</p>

style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>Paper Proposal</span></b><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'> (Due May 10). Submit a proposal that
identifies the specific scientific concept or process you will do research on
for your term paper [1 page minimum]. Briefly state why you have chosen your
specific concept/process, indicate the grade level of your students, and any
relevant state or national benchmarks that provide presumptive evidence that it
is grade level appropriate and acknowledged as something a scientifically
literate person should know. You should also identify at least one research
article that discusses misconceptions associated with your chosen
concept/process. Use footnotes to provide references for any sources you
consult, e.g. national standards documents. Do NOT use the concept of natural
selection as this will be used throughout for modeling purposes by your
instructor. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Only one student may choose a
particular scientific concept/process- first come first serve.</i> </span><span

style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>Part One: Explanation of Concept/Process</span></b><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'> (Due May 15). Submit an essay that explains
your approved scientific concept/process in a manner that is accessible to an
intelligent layperson who does not major in the science [2 page minimum]. In
your write up include a discussion of common misconceptions students have with
regard to your chosen concept/process that is based upon your own independent
research. Use footnotes to provide references for any sources you consult (e.g.
websites, books, articles) for any information that </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:

Literate Person Must Know the Concept/Process</span></b><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt'> (Due May 22). Submit an essay that presents an argument for why a
scientifically literate person, regardless of whether he/she majors in the
science or plans to teach science, should know your approved scientific concept
or process [3 page minimum]. As indicated in the example, anticipate the views
of someone who disagrees with you and clarify why you nevertheless think they
are mistaken. Use footnotes to provide references for any sources you consult
(e.g. websites, books, articles) for any information that is not considered </span></p>

use in your class to assess whether your students are proficient with regard to
the scientific concept/process you have chosen [2 page minimum]. What should
they know and be able to do in order to demonstrate their proficiency with the
concept? Use footnotes to provide references </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Part Four: Unit Plan</b>
(Due June 7). Briefly provide a context within which you would use the unit, and
a short list of your overall learning objectives. Provide one example of a
lesson that would feature the specific scientific concept or process you have
chosen for the term paper [5 page minimum]. You may presume throughout that your
reader is familiar with what you have written in the previous three parts. Use
footnotes to provide references for any sources you consult (e.g. websites,
books, articles) for any information that is not considered common </p>

style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'> (Due June 12). Submit an essay that provides
an argument that defends to the reader why, in view of all of the different
ways you might have chosen to teach the concept, the way you plan to do so (as
indicated in Part Four) is the best way to promote proficiency with regard to
the scientific concept/process you have chosen [3 page minimum]. Explicitly
consider typical misconceptions children have about the concept/process you
have chosen (Part 1) and draw attention to how your lesson will help them overcome
these misconceptions. </span>You may presume throughout that your reader is
familiar with what you have written in the previous four parts. As always, use

for that part and advice on how to improve it. Please resubmit a revised
version of the entire term paper (all five parts) at the end of term, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>regardless of whether you have revised any
or all parts</i>. As always, use footnotes to provide references for any
sources you consult (e.g. websites, books, articles) for any information that

have been addressed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NOTE: Your instructor reserves the right to turn back any
section of the paper (or the paper as a whole) ungraded if any of the following
obtain: (1) The submission contains multiple spelling or grammatical errors;
(2) The submission does not meet the minimum page length guidelines, or does so
only by the use of altered margins, the use of excessively large images or
pictures, etc.; (3) The submission does not include footnotes indicating all
references consulted; or (4) The submission does not otherwise follow
directions. You are also expected to maintain a back-up copy of anything you
submit, if only for the purposes of submitting the revised whole once more at
the end of term.<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'> </b></p>
