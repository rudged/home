<TD VALIGN="TOP">Abstract: <i>This poster will provide the reader with a detailed lesson plan that is designed to use history to explain the development of the phenomenon of plate tectonics.  It is the primary purpose of this lesson plan to inform students of the importance of scientific advancements and to illustrate the benefits of using history to support a better understanding of the nature of science.  This lesson plan illustrates that German scientist Alfred Wegener proposed that throughout most of geologic time there was only one continental mass, and one ocean.  To strengthen his argument, Wegener drew perspectives from numerous scientific fields, as well as past works from specific scientists.     Designed as an educational instrument for science education research, this lesson plan will permit students to examine how science and scientists actually work.  In addition, students will gain a better understanding of the physical processes that our planet has undergone over, long, geologic periods of time.  Students are presented with a scientific benchmark from the AAAS Project 2061, stressing the importance that: "science is in fact one vast single system, in which everything in the universe occurs in consistent patterns that are comprehensible through careful, systematic study."  The argument within this poster includes information on the need to explore the work of scientists by using history.  In addition, the crucial characteristics that scientists must obtain when investigating our natural world is exemplified.</i></TD></TR>
