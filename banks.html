<p>
Marie Louise migrated from France with her family, arriving in the port of New York on 6 Nov 1858 aboard the ship Wm. Frothingham, which set sail from Le Havre, France. She is mentioned in the 1860 census entry for her parents in Wilmington, New Hanover Co. NC, where she is identified as being nine years old and born in France. 
<p>
According to a membership application submitted to the United Daughters of the Confederacy submitted by her niece, Kate Irma nee RUDGE GRIFFITH, the family migrated to Columbia, Richmond Co. SC after the death of her father in 1860. It is unclear where they lived during the Civil War, but Marie Louise must have returned to Wilmington, New Hanover Co. NC by 18 Aug 1866, when she, her mother and brother joined the Grace Methodist Episcopal Church (Front Street Station M.E. Church South). All three are included as members on subsequent lists of church members dated Nov 1869 and 1870, the latter mentioning that Marie Louise and her mother were "removed by certificate in Feb 1873". (Marie Louise is referred to by her married name in the latter two.) 
<p>
On 7 Sep 1868, Marie Louise married <strong>John Withenbury BANKS</strong>, son of Capt. John S. BANKS & Louisa Sailor WITHENBURY in Wilmington, New Hanover Co. NC. He was born on 14 Aug 1846 in Wilmington, New Hanover Co. NC. He died of "complications of the grip" on 4 Dec 1899 in Savannah, Chatham Co. GA and was buried on 5 Dec 1899 in Laurel Grove Cemetery, Savannah, Chatham Co. GA. The Wilmington 1870 census identifies his occupation a "lightman; later census records identify him as "working in a sawmill" and a lumber inspector. He was a veteran of the Civil War, having served in Company I, 10th Regiment, NC Light Artillery, Confederate Army. He was also a member St. Paul's Episcopal Church, Savannah, Chatham Co. GA.

MARRIAGE ANNOUNCEMENT <cite>"MARRIED. In this city, on Monday,  the 9th inst., by Rev. J. H. Dally, Mr. JOHN BANKS to Miss MARIE LOUISE RUDGE."</cite> (Wed. 9 Sep 1868 Wilmington Morning Star, p. 3.)
<p>
Marie Louise and her husband are listed as members of her mother-in-law, Louisa nee WITHENBURY BANKS' household in the 1870 Census for Wilmington, New Hanover Co. NC. Her mother is also included in this entry.
<p>

CENSUS RECORD: <cite>1870 Census for Wilmington, New Hanover Co., NC:</cite> Banks, Louisa age 60,  occupation: keeping house; Banks, Charles age 30, occupant; Albert  age 18 Clerk in Office; Banks, John  age 23 Lighman; Banks, Mary L. age 19 keeping house; Banks, Robert E. age 1; Rodger, Louisa age 48 white, no occupant; Smith, Harriet age 24 black, house servant; Potter, Charlotte age 15 black, house servant. [Note "Louisa Rodger" in this record is a reference to Louisa nee MITCHELL RUDGE, Marie Louise's mother]
<p>
Marie Louise and her family migrated to GA by 1873, when she and her mother were removed by certificate from their church in Wilmington, noted above. Her daughter, Kathleen Lovett Banks, was baptized at the Lutheran Church of the Ascencion in Savannah, Chatham Co. GA on 5 Jun 1877. The family appears in the 1880 census for Baxley, Appling Co. GA taken 21 Jun 1880 where John BANKS is mentioned as working at a sawmill. They then migrated back to Savannah, Chatham Co. GA, probably as early as 1883 when her mother Louisa nee MITCHELL RUDGE is listed in the city directory for that year as a housekeeper. In any event, they definitely arrived by 1898, as John is mentioned in the Savannah City Directory for that year.

Metzger who died Wednesday at the age of 78 after a brief illness was something in the nature of an institution in the community and in the Rotary Club of Savannah, an organization which he served as sergeant-at-arms for 40 years. In business circles he was long and favorably known as an officer first with the firm of Van Kuren, then of Maier & Berkele for many years, and for a brief while with its successor, Barclay's Inc. He retired from the latter business when it ceased operations several years ago. A native of this city, he received his early education in the public schools and entered business as a youth. Among his patrons and fellow jewelers he became noteworthy as an expert in his profession who possessed an unquestioned integrity. Through the years he made a host of friends among those who consulted him in connection with gifts for the newly married and at Christmastime. No man in Georgia was better known among Rotarians. In the local club he served as sergeant-of-arms so long that when successive boards of directors of the Savannah Rotary annually chose their members, it was traditionally taken for granted that Walter Metzger would succeed himself. The local club was chartered on January 13, 1914, and among the 34 original members, composed of some of Savannah's leading business and professional men, Mr. Metzger was one. Of the original 34 his death leaves four in the club today: Fred A. Davis, Dr. J. William Hesse, Sydney Levy and Luke Pettus. Walter Metzger was a man of abiding cheerfulness; and in all his daily relationships he was never known to say an unkind thing about a fellow mortal. Always willing to serve a friend, ever willing and efficiently prepared to carry out whatever duties were assigned him, he won a host of friends and admirers throughout his long and useful life. One of the leading mottoes of Rotary is "Service Above Self." That principle was a guiding star of this good and worthy citizen. The Morning News joins his fellow members of Rotary, his friends in other fields, and the members of his family in saluting his memory with a fervent, "Well done, good and faithful servant!""</cite> (5 Feb 1954 Savannah Morning News (Savannah, GA) p. 6)

FUNERAL NOTICE: <cite>"Banks- The friends and relatives of Mr. and Mrs. John S. Banks and family are invited to attend the funeral of the former from the residence 515 Bolton Street East at 2 o'clock this afternoon at Bonaventure."</cite> (22 Nov 1915 Savannah Morning News p. 2)
<p>
LETTER WRITTEN IN HONOR OF HIM: <cite>"John S. Banks. That he was energetic, progressive personally likeable and one of the best known of the younger business men of Savannah but inadequately describes John S. Banks whose death occurred yesterday. He was public spirited, was always ready and glad to do what he could for the interest of Savannah and his passing removes a man of whom it may be said that he was a good citizen. He will be remembered specially for the part he played in the organization of the Rotary Club of which he was the first president an office for which on account of his personality he was unusually well fitted. Expressions of appreciation on the part of members of the club indicate very clearly how much of his success must be considered as the result of his efforts. That his death will be greatly regretted need hardly be said and regret is felt by all the more because his life ended while he was yet a young man with the hope at least of many more years of usefulness."</cite> (22 Nov 1915 Savannah Morning News p. 6)

OBITUARY: <em>"Bomco Grieves the Loss of Its President, Pete Banks. Gloucester, October 17, 2005. Neill Kramer "Pete" Banks, Jr., 75, died peacefully at his home in Gloucester, MA on Wednesday, September 21, 2005. Born on March 10, 1930 in Savannah, GA, he was the son of the late Sara Neville Banks and Neill Kramer Banks. Pete was well-known as the president of Bomco, Inc., an innovative metal manufacturing firm with nearly 100 employees and over 7,000 different production items including metal formed parts for aerospace and industry, glass-to-metal seal assemblies and wire handling accessories. Pete loved this business and the daily challenges it presented particularly when a job appeared impossible due to its technical nature. He had a keen interest in each of his employees and helped create a work environment with employee training and benefits which had made Bomco, Inc. not only a highly respected employer but also a recognized leader in the metal forming industry. Pete graduated cum laude from the Kent School in Connecticut in 1948. He went on, with a full Navy R.O.T.C. scholarship, to graduate from Cornell University in New York in 1953 with a degree in mechanical engineering. Pete then spent three years in the U.S. Navy, serving as an electronics material officer and later as a navigator aboard a destroyer. In 1956, Pete along with his wife Ann moved to North Bennington, VT. There, he worked as a production manager for the Warren Wire Co., of Pownall, VT where he came into contact with the fledgling business of Bomco Pressed Metal and Spinning Co., of Gloucester. Fascinated with the metal spinning process, he joined the company and moved to Gloucester in 1960. Pete became president of the newly incorporated Bomco, Inc. During the 1960s and 70s, in addition to running a business and raising a family, Banks was an active member of the Gloucester business community serving on industrial development, bank and hospital boards. He was also instrumental in gaining passage of a bill preserving the natural beauty of Cape Ann. Pete loved to spend time aboard his 1924 Crosby Yawl sailboat, "Spindrift," and rarely missed a year of sailing to Maine. He was an avid reader and was well-versed in world events and situations. He is survived by his children Deaken Knight Banks, Lansing Decamp Banks, Pamela Banks and four grandchildren. Edited with permission of the Gloucester Daily Times. A memorial service was held on Saturday, October 1, at the Bomco facilities that Pete Banks loved as his second home. Family, employees, community and school friends celebrated Pete Bank’s life in an outdoor service that was followed by a luncheon on a cloudless and warm October day."</em> (Bomco News Fall 2005 Page 1 of 3 http://bomco.com/fall05.htm 3/15/2010)
