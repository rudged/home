She was of Scotch descent and belonged to the family of Bruces, whihc has been conspicuous in the annals of Scotland and in the Revolutionary history and America. Her father was Dr. Samuel Child Bruce, a physician of Moore County, and the grandson of Charles Bruce, who was a noted figure in the Revolutionary history of North Carolina, having been a member of the constitutional convention of North Carolina. The home of Charles Bruce was at Bruce's Cross Roads in Guilford County, the earliest place of meeting of friends of liberty and the scenes of many stirring events of the revolution. Mrs. Dowd's mother was Martha Kennedy, a daughter of David Kennedy, also a prominent actor in the war of the Revolution. After the Revolution was over he built a gunshop in Deep River, Moore County, using slave labor. Lydia Josephine Bruce was married in 1847 to Murdock B. Person of Carthage, who died three years later, and from this union was one child, Fannie, now the wife of Mr. H. B. Adams, a lawyer of Monroe. In 1853 Mrs. Person was married to Clement Dowd, a young lawyer of Carthage and a veteran of the Civil War. The children of this union were Misses Ella and Mattie Dowd and Mr. Willis B. Dowd, Dr. Jerome Dowd, Mrs. E. K. Bryan of Memphis, Tenn., Mrs. W. F. Harding and Mr. Herman Dowd. All of Mrs. Dowd's children survive her. Mrs. Dowd was a woman of the old school and not inclined to be influenced by the modern tendency of women towards interest and participation in affairs outside of the home. Her life was centered in her home, her neighborhood and her church. She loved domestic life and her children were to her a supreme joy. She delighted to serve them, to play with them and be a companion to them. It was this absorbing interest in her family that won all of her children to her with a devotion that was supreme. For many years her children have assembled for a family reunion at Christmas. Mrs. Dowd took the most childish delight in the festivity and exchange of gifts and greetings of this holy day. She had looked forward to the Christmas just passed with her usual happy anticipation and a few days before she was taken ill she visited the stores and laid in her supply of presents for her children, grandchildren and friends. It was perhaps the exposure incident to this shopping that brought on the illness that turned the Christmas occasion into one of sorrow in her home. She realized the probability of her death and faced it with Christian resignation. Her illness was not one of great suffering, and in her last hours she was in a very cheerful mood and talked freely to all her children. A short time before she lost consciousness she called her oldest son, Mr. Willis Dowd, to her bedside and said: "My dying message to my children, who have been the pride and joy of my life, is this: I have lived a long and I trust successful life. I have believed in God and tired to follow the example of Christ. God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. My prayer is that my children will believe as I have believed and live as I have tried to live. I know if they do all will be well and we shall be reunited in the world to which I am going."</em> (27 Dec 1912 The Charlotte Evening Chronicle p. 1; 27 Dec 1912 The Charlotte News p. 2)

Her charity and genuine sympathy made her the friend of the distressed and the needy. She will be greatly missed and sincerely mourned. The body of Mrs. Adams was brought here Friday afternoon and was taken to her home on Washington street. Funreal [sic] was held at 10 o'clock Saturday morning, Dr. J. C.
