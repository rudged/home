He used to travel around with it to trade shows and be very excited if someone had a new slide rule for his collection or if he was invited to show it somewhere. He would send the above postcard as a thank-you note." (Cynthia Carr-Kramer 8/00).<HR></P><P><HR><I>Last updated on 4 Sep 2000.</I> </P></BODY></HTML>
