<cite>"I do remember your grandmother [Elizabeth ROTH BIERI]. I have a very vivid picture in my memory of her sitting on sunny side of south porch at our house and patching overalls for my father and brothers. I was trying to learn to sew at the time and was fascinated by the dainty stitches she used on the patches. I'm sure they never were so carefully done after she was gone."</cite> (letter from Marion Roth Yates to Esther Wyss Burridge)

According to Milda Wyss Miller, her granddaughter, she moved to Croton Dam (Newaygo Co.), prior to her death in May 1913 (?) <cite>"After Grandpa Bieri died, Grandma became ill. She was a diabetic and had problems with circulation in her legs. Mama [Susanna BIERI (WYSS)] being a nurse could help most so Papa [Alfred WYSS] insisted on bringing her to Croton. She was a great care and died of "gangrene" in her foot. This is why she moved to Croton."</cite>

In a letter from Olive Wyss Bracker (Alfred's daughter) to her half sister Lena Anne Wyss Rudge (21 Jan ) she writes--<cite>" I can remember when Dad heard that his sister Anne was gone. He felt so badly. Also can remember when some one wrote him, I don't know who, that his mother was very poorly and if he was going to keep his promise to her, he would have to come soon. You see, when he left Switzerland [1906], he promised her he would be back. Well your mother [Susanna Bieri Wyss] thought he should go, and helped make it possible for him to go. Grandma and Grandpa had $300 from her, but were not in a position to pay it back, and she wanted him to use that money to go. So actually she made it possible for him to go."</cite>

OBITUARY- <cite>"OBITUARY. After an illness of five weeks Mrs. Alfred Wyss passed away Friday afternoon, October 22.

A few years later she became a nurse, and for several years served as a Deaconess nurse in the Wayne Hospital, Detroit.. In 1898 she was united in marriage to Alfred Wyss. The family moved to Croton eight years ago [1907] and since then the loving sympathy and ever ready helpfulness of the departed have made her a necessary factor in the community life. Her presence will be missed by many, for she was loved by all who knew her. Taken ill the latter part of September, Mrs. Wyss gradually grew weaker until her death last Friday. The body was taken to Lowell, where the funeral services were held in the German M. E. church at 10 o'clock Sunday morning. Interment was made in the Bailey cemetery. Mrs. Wyss leaves a husband, son, four daughters, two sisters and two brothers, besides a host of other relatives and friends who mourn her loss.  IN MEMORIAM. In life's golden age is she taken, Leaving many a sad heart to miss her. Thus early is called to account For a noble life to her Master. For she ever loved to be helpful And sunshine she cast around her, By her ever ardent longing To do the will of her Master. Thus hath she lived and thus did she pass With no thought, but to duty united. May her ashes rest in sweet peace hence on earth. Her spirit abide with the angels."</cite>  Second obituary <cite>"Once more death has entered our midst and taken a loved neighbor and friend. Susanna Bieri, wife of Alfred Wyss and daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John Bieri, was born in Scharganegg, Switzerland, January 15, 1867. At the age of 16 she came with her parents to America and settled in Lowell, Mich. She became a nurse at the Deaconess hospital in Detroit. In 1898 she was united in marriage with Alfred Wyss; the family moved to Croton eight years ago. Mrs. Wyss will be missed in the home, in the community, and in the church. Her heart's interest was in her Master's work. She said she was the Lord's and whatever was His will was hers; if His will to spare her or take her, it was alright. She had such loving communion with the Lord and He saw fit to take her. What is our loss is her eternal gain. She leaves to mourn her loss a husband, one son, four daughters, two sisters, two brothers, and other relatives. Funeral services were held in the M. E. church at Lowell. Burial in the Lowell cemetery. Thus ends a devoted life."</cite> Third obituary <cite>"Everyone here mourns the death of Mrs. Alfred Wyss. She was an earnest worker in God's vineyard and one who could ill be spared. Many of her kind deeds will live long in memory."</cite> Fourth obituary <cite>"MRS. ALFRED WYSS. In Memory. Back in the forest, one day, a little spring forced its way through a crevice in the rocks and wound its course merrily down to the river, in the valley below. The song of its waters, rippling over the pebbles, was restful music in those silent places. The wild flowers bloomed along its banks, nourished by its grateful moisture carried about on the changing breeze. The wild life of the woods and the air drank of its cool waters and was refreshed. Whereso-e'er it passed there was rejoicing in nature. Then came a day when the source of the spring failed and its music was heard no more. The wild flowers hung their heads and in that part of the forest nature was sad. As with the little spring, which had fulfilled its humble mission, doing good in nature, so with our deceased friend, Mrs. Wyss-a simple quiet soul. She fulfilled her mission in life by devotion to her family, by working for her church and by lending a helping hand to the sick and the sorrowing. Sadness follows her passing beyond, in the little community where she was part of the daily life, and her gentle ways and kindly heart will keep her in our memory. May she rest in peace. Croton, Mich. October 25, 1915. W. A. T."</cite> Fifth obituary: <em>""Mrs. Alfred Wyss of Croton Buried Here Sunday. Mrs. Alfred Wyss of Croton died Friday after an illness of three weeks aged 48 years. Funeral services were held at 1 p.m. Sunday at the Lowell German Methodist Church; burial at the Bailey cemetery. Rev. H. Bank officiating clergyman. Susanna Bieri came to Lowell from Switzerland with her parents in 1883. She married Alfred Wyss and lived here, where he was employed in the electric power houses until about seven years ago, when they moved to Croton, where Mr. Wyss is superintendant of the big power plant of thte Grand Rapids-Muskegon company. Mrs. Wyss is survived by her husband, one son and four daughters.
