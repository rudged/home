I commend my spirit to God, who gave it, and I desire for my body a Christian burial as my children may direct and direct that a suitable grave stone shall mark my last resting place in the earth.	2. I devise the lot and a half lying in the eastern suburbs of Charlotte, which I purchased from B. D. Heath, to my son, Herman Dowd for life, and if he shall marry and his wife survive him, then to his wife for life, and if Herman shall leave a child or children then I devise the remainder to such child or children, but if he shall not marry or shall leave any living children at his death, then after the life estates created for him and his wife, I devise the said lot and a half to his brothers and sisters living at the time of his death.	3. It is my will that if I should die before making contemplated improvements on the said lot and a half devised to Herman Dowd, that my executors shall cause to be erected on the said lot and a half a dwelling house and such outhouses are necessary for the proper use and enjoyment of the property at a cost of twenty-five hundred dollars. If I shall die before the improvements are made by me and after I have commenced them, my executors shall complete them, so that the entire cost of the improvements including money spent by me, shall not exceed twenty five hundred dollars.	4. It is my will that the specific articles of personal property mentioned in the paper attached to this will and written in my own handwriting shall be the property of the person or persons therein indicated and directed.	5.
