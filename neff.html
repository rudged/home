Here's a genealogy for one branch of the Neff family that migrated from Switzerland to New York and ultimately Wisconsin. My research has been focussed on the descendants of 18. Isaac Neff below. Please also visit <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~neff/"> The Neff Genealogy Home Page</a>, run by Don Neff, and by far the most comprehensive site for genealogical information on the Neff family.

Since 2005, the Neff Family Historical Society has sponsored a Neff surname
DNA project with Family Tree DNA of Houston, Texas.  We would invite a MALE
family member from this line (surname Neff) to join in this research project.  For additional

<p>
<cite>"[Possibly one and the same as]... Hans Jacob Neff who we identify as [G26], he was the son of Konrad Naf born at Kloten, Kt. Zuerich in 1680. He [Hans Konrad Neef] was married for the third time to Anna Barbara Deppeler at Wallisellen on 1 Jun 1723. There were two children by this third marriage one being the Hans Jacob [G26] bpt. 25 Jan 1728 at Wallisellen [CH8302]. We published the story of this family in our September 1994 issue of NEFF NEWS. The Neffs on the ship Mercury were all from Wallisellen and came with a group led by Reformed minister Maurice Goetschy. The group's trip is well documented and they left from Wallisellen on 5 Oct 1734 and went directly to Rotterdam where they boarded the ship for London. There was a brief stay in England for financial reasons before boarding the Mercury for Philadelphia. We have traced a number of family members into York Co. PA and down to Frederick, Maryland. We do not have anything further on this Jacob Neff [G26] after his arrival to America. NEFF NEWS 9-94.  While the Jacob Neff [Neef] you are looking for in Schenectady could be the same Jacob as [G26], I would have my doubts. First, he would have been age 16 when he married Catherine Angst marriage date of 1744 [note: a subsequent note clarifies this is the date of her <cite>baptism</cite>, not their marriage]. I believe the church you are referring to is the Dutch Reformed under Calvin and not Zuerich Reformed under Zwingli."</cite> (email from William Neff to William Starks 15 Dec 1996).

He was born on 26 Mar 1762 in Caughnawaga, Montgomery Co. NY and baptized on 12 May 1765 in Reformed Protestant Dutch Church, Caughnawaga, Mont. Co. NY. He appears to have died on 31 Oct 1849 in Allentown, Allegheny Co. NY and is buried in the Allentown Cemetery, Allentown, Allegheny Co. NY with his son and daughter in law, Nathan and Jane nee Martin Neff. (This contrasts with a previous claim that he died ca. 1835 in Scott, Cortland Co. NY.) He was a member of the Congregational Church Of Homer in 1813.

A Jacob Neff is in the 1800 Census for Amsterdam, Montgomery Co. NY, p. 103. The household is listed as having four boys under ten (Cornelius (9), Jacob (7), Abraham (4), Judson; one man 16-26 (Isaac (12)?) and one man 26-45 (Jacob (38)), one girl under ten (Polly (2), one woman 26-45 (Olive (36)).

<p>
There is a record of a "Kneff, Jacob with three males, two females, and one voter" in the 1825 census for the Town of Scott, Cortland Co. From what we know about the ages of his children, this could refer to this Jacob Neff, as he had two young sons and a daughter at this time. This could also refer to his son Jacob, if the latter (age 32) was married, had three children and was indeed living in the area.

Jacob Neff Jr. and his wife appear to  be the older couple living with his son Nathan Neff and his wife Jane nee Martin in the 1830 census for Homer, Cortland Co. NY.

Altho having passed the period usually allotted to the human race, Mrs. Neff is as healthy and active as the average woman is at fifty, and entered in the spirit of the occasion with as much life and enjoyment as anyone present.

OBITUARY - <cite>"OBITUARY. MRS. POLLY NEFF. The subject of this brief sketch died in Lake Mills last Friday, October 1st. The cause of her death was not any particular disease, but she had lived her generous lease of life, and  having done her full share in the 93 years she has lived, was called away without sickness or pain. Mrs. Neff was born in Blanford, Massachusetts, and was married to Mr. Neff in New York state. During the year 1845 they came to Wisconsin, settling in Racine county. One year later they removed  to Lake Mills, where they ever afterwards resided. Some four years ago Mr. Neff died, since which time Mrs. Neff has resided with her son, Eli. There were born to her nine children, eight of whom are living. Six sons reside in this state; two in Lake Mills, two in Adams county, and two in Clark county. The two daughters, Mrs. John Young and Mrs. J. S. Jackson, reside in Lake Mills. the funeral services were held in the residence of Eli Neff on Sunday, October 4, Rev. Mr. Patterson officiating. During all Mrs. Neff's long life she was never once treated by a doctor for any disease, and even at the time of her death she had been confined to the bed but four days. She was a woman who made friends and kept them, and while her large circle of acquaintances deplore the loss to her children, they can but feel how kind it was in Him who rules to let her live far beyond the allotted time, and when the day for her cares and pleasures to cease had come, to so peacefully take her back."</cite> (Lake Mills Leader 7 Oct 1886, p. 2) 2ND OBITUARY <cite>"LAKE MILLS-Mrs. Isaac Neff, aged 93, mother of Wm., Eli and Bert Neff, one of Lake Mills' earliest settlers, having occupied the same farm for over 40 years, was consigned to the village cemetery last Sunday, the 3rd inst.

Mrs. Neff, as well as Mr. Neff, will be missed by her neighbors and many friends, for enemies they had none...OAKLAND-Mrs. Neff, a very old lady who resided near the town line, was buried on Sunday last. The Rev. Peterson conducted the funeral services."</cite> (Jefferson County Union 8 Oct 1886, v. 17 no. 32, p. 1)

After their deaths, Isaac and Polly's descendants held a number of family reunions that were written up in a local newspaper:
<p>
<cite>"Reunion of the Descendants of Isaac and Polly Neff. In the early days when the stream of immigration was flowing westward Isaac and Polly Neff and eight of their nine children left their home in Cortland county, N. Y. to found a new home in the Great West. They settled first in Walworth Co., but a little later came to Lake Mills and bought the farm on the banks of Hope Lake which remained the family home until their death and for many years afterward was owned by their son. Last Thursday 19 of the descendants of this worthy pioneer coupled together with a grandson of the twin brother of Polly Neff, and wives, husbands and several old friends, gathered at Tyranena Park for their second annual reunion. There were present 5 grand children, 6 great grandchildren and 8 great great grandchildren and of these but three bore the family name, which seems in danger of passing in a few more generations as has been the case in several of the pioneer families of this vicinity. That the picnic dinner is quite an important consideration in such gatherings adding greatly to the enjoyment of the day, each of the 35 who gathered about the convenient tables furnished by the park and placed on a knoll overlooking our beautiful lake would gladly testify. At such gatherings acquaintances are renewed, family tradition recalled, and all are drawn closer together in the bonds of friendship and good fellowship. Such a day means much to the older people and is greatly enjoyed by the younger, therefore well worth the while. We believe that more frequent "Gatherings of the Clans" should be held to keep alive a sense of our obligation to those who toiled so incessantly that we who follow after them may enjoy the fruits of their labor, to promote sociability and to strengthen the bonds of fellowship."</cite> (Lake Mills Leader 2 Sep 1920, p. 1) 
<p>
<cite>"Cousin's Picnic. The Annual Cousin's Picnic was held in Tyranena Park, Wednesday, July 19. After a bounteoaus dinner was served in the large dining room of the par, cards and games were indulged in.

<p>
<cite>"NEFF COUSINS' PICNIC - July 18, 1923. Right glad and happy are we to be, members of the same ancestral tree. These yearly feastings bind the tie of kinship as the years go by; and prove to all that nature intends, because in us, the same blood blends. A tenderer love, within each bosom throbs, my dears, because we'er COUSINS.
<p>
Amid our feastings let us recall
Our grandsire, so straight and tall, 
Snow white hair; a mind so true
To reason and clear of view.
His spoken word was known to be
Accepted, without a guarantee.
He value placed, beyond his time
On breeds of cow, and hen and swine.
He watched with tender paternal care
Each sturdy son and daughter fair, 
That none from virtues path might stary
Or be mistaken in a business way.
<p>
We are truly sorry for all of you, 
Born too late, you ne'er your frand dam knew
Short of statue, a rolly polly,
Happy faced - well named Aunt Polly.
All the household arts she knew
From the best soft soap to a 'par snip' stew, 
The spinning of yarn and knitting socks
Making butter and bed quilt blocks.
A ready wit, quaint stories old
She had a store and aptly told
Fitted well in many a story.
Serenely gave her best without a worry.
Were this sturdy pair, here, today, with me
Too many barren branches would they see.
<p>
Born unto this most worthy pair
Six sturdy sons, three daughters fair
That followed where they led the way;
So it's fitting here, for us, today
Due homage pay, and vow to maintain
The sterling virtues of the NAME."</cite>
<p>
<cite>"NEFF FAMILY REUNION. The annual reunion of the Neff family descendants held at Tyranena Park, Thursday of last week was a pleasant occasion to be recalled with pleasure by the thirty-seven who were privileged to be present and  among those were representatives from Mellette, S. D., Minneapolis, Elroy, Boston, Milton Jct., and Cambridge, in addition to the local members. The family 'tree' being compiled by Mrs. Addie Neff Holliday of Anaheim, Cal. came in for its due share of interest. This traces the origin of families in Switzerland early in the 16th century. An interesting agreement between Isaac Neff, the ancestor who settled in Wisconsin before it was admitted to the Union was read. This agreement was dated August 28, 1811, Elizabethtown, N. Y., and the said Isaac Neff, with three others, agreed to chop and clean off 50 acres of land fit for the harrow and seeding and build 12 rods of good and sufficient rail fence to each acre before the first day of September, 1812.  For this work they were to receive 2 pounds 10 shillings currency per acre, one good quart of whiskey per acre, have their board and washing and have a team and chain furnished them. They agreed to house the ashes from the burning of the timber and were entitled to half of them. An excellent picture of the group was taken by Mr. Panzer which will serve as a reminder of this pleasant occasion." </cite>(Lake Mills Leader 12 Aug 1926) Here's a <a href="nf.html">photograph</a> believed to have been the one taken at this reunion.

Descendants of Isaac and Polly Neff who came from New York in the early 40's and settled on the Town Line, held their annual reunion at Tyranena Park Thursday. Four generations were represented, there being 4 grandchildren, 6 great grandchildren, 12 great-great grandchildren, and 6 great-great-great-grandchildren of this worthy couple present. Two families of Neffs from Madison, descendants of the same line as the local branch of the family, met with them, and Mr. and Mrs. Fred C. Smith and daughter and grandson came on from Minneapolis for this occasion which left a pleasant memory in the life of each one of the fifty-four privileged to be present."</cite> (Lake Mills Leader 18 Jul 1929)

MEMORIAL LETTER- <cite>"MISS MARY JACKSON FISH. It is hard for me to realize that the gentle lady who bore the name above, has passed from my life. My earliest childhood friend, my girlhood's confidant, and this womanhood of sickness and suffering still true as the stars to the faith of her earlier years. So quiet and reserved that few were aware of her worth; so distrustful of her own abilities, yet always, as a student, one of the foremost in her class. Few women in Wisconsin surpass her in scholarship, and none in integrity of character. Without envy, above malice, she based her own womanhood upon its real worth and gave justice to all others, failing not to delight in whatsoever is good and beautiful, with that generosity which was her nature. I believe she was wholly incapable of unworthy thought or speech. She observed silence rather than speak ill, or to no purpose. One after another the old friends are laid in the little cemetery. New friends come, but not to take their places. Life grows heavy with the cares it brings; death seems not so great a foe, with so many on the other shore. The little Lake is dearer for the memory of dead feet that have walked its shores; none dearer, none more devoted, none surer to tread the golden streets of the Heavenly City, than Mary, whose life was sacred to Friendship and faithful to Love.

<p>
OBITUARY- <i>"Mr. Leander Stetson. Mr. Leander L. Stetson was born April 18, 1838 in Warren, Vermont. At the age of eleven he left his home in the east with his parents and his three sisters and journeyed westward to Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin, where relatives had preceded htem in that great wave of emigration which swept towards the west in those early times. For a year the family lived on a farm near Fort Atkinson. At the end of that time the father purchased the farm in Oakland, where Mr. Stetson spent the greater part of his life. In 1854 his father died leaving to his only son, then only sixteen years of age, the care of the farm and the family. This responsibility he bore patiently and uncomplainingly. Here for over fifty years he worked faithfully, and by hard labor, attained that success which won him the name of one of the best farmers of the country. It was here that he acquired those sterling qualities of character which only the trials and hardships of pioneering life can give. In 1866 he married Miss Laura Jackson. Four children were born into the home, all of whom were with him to cheer and comfort at thelast. Nine years ago being obliged to leave the farm on account of failing strength, he moved to Lake Mills where he remained until his death, March 24, at the age of seventy-four. Mr. Stetson leaves to mourn his loss, his wife, four children, Winslow, Mrs. Bruce Taylor, and Eugene of this city, and Mrs. George Gohlke of Boston, Mass., seven grandchildren and two sisters, Mrs. William Telfer of Oakland and Mrs. J.W. Uglow of Concordia, Kansas. Mr. Stetson's life speaks for itself. Those who knew him recognized in him the elements which make a man. Besides being an ideal husband and father he was a good friend and neighbor, always thoughtful of others. The fact that would be against Mr. Stetson's wishes, restrains us from eulogizing the good he has accomplished. It must suffice to say that he leaves a host of friends who will miss him, and who, if they should speak, would testify  that their lives are the better for having known him."</i> (Lake Mills Leader 4 Apr 1912)

He was educated in the district schools of Jefferson County, and at the early age of thirteen years began to show a spirit of independence by working out on farms. At first he received only $8 per month, but his wages were gradually increased. In 1868 he came to Clark County, where he has since made his home. He has had many years of experience in the lumber camps, working for himself and others, and in that way accumulated a little start. In 1872 he bought his present farm in Levis Township, which consists of 160 acres. By the expenditure of much time and hard labor he has cleared his land and has it under a fine state of cultivation. He is regarded as one of the enterprising citizens of the township; he is a Republican and takes an active part in politics.

<cite>"DORR A. NEFF Dorr A. Neff, proprietor of a good farm in Levis Township, was born in Lake Mill Township, Jefferson County, Wis., June 18, 1851, son of Albertus and Mary (Babcock) Neff. The father was a native of Cortland County, N.Y., and was a farmer. He and his family came to Wisconsin, locating first in Jefferson County, whence they came to Clark County in the fall of 1868. The journey was made by train to Sparta, and then by stage through Black River Falls, to Neillsville, where they arrived with nothing but a few dollars in cash. Their family at this time consisted of three children, besides the father, namely: Dorr A., Addie and Angie. They got a yoke of cattle, building a log stable, and also had a cow. The mother had died in Jefferson County when the subject of this sketch was 9 years old, and Albertus Neff married for a second wife, Isabelle Short. She died in 1902 and Albertus passing away in 1901, at the age of 78 years, in Clark County. He had continued to make his home on the farm, a part of which he had cleared. In the fall of 1868, Dorr A. Neff, then 18 years old, began working in the woods as a "swamper" for A.W. Clark. In March of the following year he bought a tract of forty acres in Section 1, Levis Township, there being an old log house on the place, and the trees cut on seven acres. A road had been laid out and partly cut over. Here his father and stepmother, with the children, took up their residence, and he cleared a little more of the land, after which he went to work for old Dr. French on Jack Creek, to prepare for running logs. Later, he worked in the woods for A. Jones French, the doctor's brother, and in the following spring was engaged in the drive on Wedges' Creek. He then resumed the work of clearing his farm, but the next winter worked for Anson Green, on Poplar River. After again working on his farm, he was employed the succeeding winter by J.W. Wilson in logging on Cunningham Creek. Each summer he spent on his farm, his next winter's employment being on the East Fork of Black River. For six or seven years he was foreman for T.M. Schranton. In July of the first summer that he spent on his farm he had bought forty acres more in the same section of Levis Township, which tract also was covered with timber. His farm is now well cleared and has been still further increased in size, as he has since bought two other forty-acre tracts, making a total of 160 acres. His present residence is a frame dwelling of eight rooms, the original log house, which stood in front of it, having had one room only. During the early years Mr. Neff raised sheep, but now keeps cows and devotes his attention to dairying, raising graded Holstein cattle. He aided in getting roads cut through the township, and has performed other useful service, having been at various times a member and chairman of the Levis Township board, and having also the district school board, and his sister, Addie, who is now Mrs. C. C. Holliday, of Minneapolis, was at one time for two terms county school superintendent. Mr. Neff is a member of the Equitable Fraternity Union. A Republican in politics, he has taken part in county conventions and for Real Estate Company of Lake Mills to this section, and they have since done useful work in the county. The second season after Mr. Neff settled in Levis Township a school district was formed here, with his assistance and a small log schoolhouse built, the first teacher being Lydia Irely. She later married J.L. Gates, former head of the Gates Land Company, of Neillsville. Dorr A. Neff was married in 1878, to Agnes Carter, who was born in Jefferson County, daughter of Edward and Mary Carter, who settled in Washburn Township, Clark County, where both died. Mr. Carter was, for a number of years prominent in the affairs of that township. Mrs. Neff died in 1902, at the age of 43 years, leaving four children - Alberta, Gladys, Lola and Charles. Alberta, who married Walter Proctor, now resides in Portland.; she has two children, Louise and William. Gladys lives on the home farm with her father. Lola, whi is the wife of Hugh Campbell, lives in Cincinnati; she has two children, Agnes and Bruce. Charles resides on the home farm. He married Elvira Hemp, Oct 11, 1917.
