It is unclear to me whether his uniform is that of a drummer during his days in the infantry, or perhaps what he wore when he was a cabin boy on a blockade runner. He appears on the left. A friend, named "George Weber", appears on the right. The caption to the original photograph reads "John William Rudge    George Weber."<HR></P><P><HR><I>Last updated on 6 Jun 1999.</I> </P></BODY></HTML>
