<a name="one"><strong>1. John<sup>1</sup> BATH</strong>. He was born ca. 1777 according to his burial record and according to the note mentioned above was of English descent. He is referred to as being of Richmond, Henrico Co. VA in a record of his marriage and also a letter of consent to this marriage by his father-in-law, John B. Williamson. He died of apoplexy and was buried on 4 Nov 1841 in the Shockoe Cemetery, Richmond, VA according to his burial record (below).
<p>
John married <strong>Lucy WILLIAMSON</strong>, daughter of John B. and Mary Oglevy nee BREEDLOVE WILLIAMSON, on 11 May 1810 in Henrico Co., VA. According to her burial record, she was born ca. 1792 in Henrico Co., VA. (This date is consistent with the suggestion in the record of marriage noted below that she was not quite of full age.) She was buried on 11 Apr 1849 in the Shockoe Cemetery, Richmond, VA according to her burial record (below). Information about her ancestry is located <a href="williamson.html">here</a>.

<a name="three"><strong>3. Mary E.<sup>2</sup> BATH</strong> (<a href="#one">John</a><sup>1</sup>). She was born ca. 1820 in VA. She died on 12 Jun 1851. She married <strong>John J. PENDLETON</strong> on 31 Oct 1850 in Richmond, Henrico Co. VA. John was born ca. 1805 and died on 22 Aug 1885 in Richmond, VA. According to a record of his death, John was a capitalist and a widower. They were both originally buried in the Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, VA, but their remains were relocated to the Shockoe Hill Cemetery also in Richmond on 23 Oct 1923.

MARRIAGE NOTICE: <em>"Married on Thurs. the 30st Oct. [Oct 31, 1850] by Rev. R.B.C. Howell, D.D., Mr. John J. Pendleton to Miss Mary Bath, all of this city."</em> (Richmond Whig/Daily Richmond Whig 2 Nov 1850; Richmond Republican and General Advertiser 5 Nov 1850)

Mary E. nee Bath Pendleton is mentioned in a newspaper ad relating to a court battle regarding her parent's estate dated 27 Dec 1850 above, but not in a November 1852 ad. 
<p>
John J. Penderton may have married someone by the name of Mary Jane, who was born ca. 1822 and died on 4 Sep 1841. She is also buried in the Shockoe Hill Cemetery. It is possible John had issue by one of these marriages, but if so, they are not mentioned in his will.

<p>
<a name="four"><strong>4. Samuel S.<sup>2</sup> BATH</strong> (<a href="#one">John</a><sup>1</sup>). He was born ca. 1825 and lived in Charleston, South Carolina ca. 1852 according to several deed records associated with his brother-in-law, Archibald Pae from 1852 onward that mention him.) 
<p>
His relatives recall he was a wealthy property owner in Richmond who became involved in "some trouble" that ultimately led him to flee to the West, accompanied for a short time with his nephew, James A. Pae. According to the latter, Samuel S. became interested in the mining industry and ultimately amassed another fortune. His nephew claimed he took on an assumed name, "Charles Hill", and indeed was one and the same as the Charles Hill who died in Los Angeles, CA without a will ca. 1902 leaving an estate valued in excess of $142,000. Multiple articles were written in Richmond newspapers regarding his surviving relatives attempts to claim this fortune. Similar claims were made by multiple other individuals in numerous other states on behalf of their long lost relatives. Ultimately the courts concluded that the Charles Hill who died was an estranged member of a Massachusetts family.  
<p>
NEWSPAPER ACCOUNTS CLAIMING SAMUEL S. BATH WAS CHARLES HILL:<EM>"CHARLES HILL'S HEIRS MAY BE RICHMONDERS. It has been practically proven that three of the heirs to the fortune left by Charles Hill, who died in California some time ago, reside in this city. Mr. Hill died leaving a bank account of $142,000, besides a large amount of real estate. The local claimants to the immense fortune are: Charles S. Cook of No. 201 Randolph street, Mrs. Dora V. Houston, 1014 west Main street, and Mrs. Maud C. Plunkett. In addition to these several of their relatives in North and South Carolina have joined in the fight for the fortune...Mr. Diggs [a lawyer hired to pursue the claim] became interested in the case through Charles. S. Cook, who heard the story from Mr. Peay [sic], and it was so straight that he began to inquire into it as a result... "</em>(1 Aug 1902 Richmond Dispatch (Richmond, VA) p. 4); <EM>"RICHMOND PEOPLE HEIRS TO FORTUNE... AN ASSUMED NAME. The grounds for the claims of Mr. Cook and others is that Hill was living under an assumed name at the time of his death, which was very sudden. They contend that he was in reality no other than Samuel S. Bath, who once lived in Richmond, but was compelled to leave this section of the country in 1854 on account of a difficulty in which he became involved. He located in the vicinity of San Francisco, earned a fortune, and died a wealthy man... Hill, or Bath, before leaving Richmond, lived on West Main Street, just in front of where the Jefferson Hotel now stands. He was an influential citizen and regarded as quite wealthy, owning much property in that vicinity. The court records show where many deeds were recorded by him in various deals in which he was interested. Upon becoming involved in trouble, Hill sold all of his property, and with his nephew, James Pea [sic], who now lives in Newport News, fled to the West, where Hill soon became interested in the mining industry which was just springing up in that country. He accumulated a fortune. After remaining with his uncle for a short time, Pea [sic] tired of the country and returned to his native State, going to Newport News, where he is now working in the shipyards. It was principally through Pea that the heirs in Virginia and North Carolina became interested in the legacy he being confident that Hill was no other than Bath... HANDWRITING IDENTICAL... Several specimens of the handwriting of Bath have been forwarded to San Francisco where they have been compared with that of Hill, and Attorney Freeman writes that the similarity is really remarkable. Much other evidence of this character has been unearthed... "</em> (1 Aug 1902 The Times (Richmond, VA) p. 8); <em>"CHAS.HILL'S FORTUNE... Mr. Sands, discussing the results of his trip last night, said: "I think that I can prove beyond a doubt that my clients are the true heirs. At the Home of the Good Samaritan, where Bath died, I was told that the photographs given me by my clients resembled him more than any others that had been shown, and that the photos of Mr. Bath's family showed a remarked resemblance to the dead man... "</em> (27 Sep 1902 Richmond Dispatch (Richmond, VA) p. 1); <em>"Los Angeles County: Its Towns, Villages and Surburban Places. PASADENA PRODUCES HILL CLAIMANT. WASHINGTON WOMAN WRITES THAT HIS NAME WAS BATH. He stabbed a Man and Ran Away... PASADENA. Office of the Times, No. 26 South Raymond avenue, Sept. 9-Charles Hill, the old miser who died in Los Angeles leaving $142,000 and a lot of people to fight over it, seems to have had an unlimited acquaintance with people who knew him for somebody else. Mrs. W. R. Clark of North Los Rombles avenue, wife of the former secretary of the Board of Trade, has received a letter from Mrs. Kate S. Turpin of Washington, D.C., which reveals strange incidents in the life of Hill, whether the same Hill or not. Mrs. Turpin insists that he is the same, and both Mr. and Mrs. Clark declare that she is not a woman to misrepresent or jump at vague conclusions. The Clarks boarded with her in Washington for a year and became well acquainted. Mrs. Turpin owns a large establishment in the national capital city. In her letter to Mrs. Clark, Mrs. Turpin says: "I have just received your papers with an account of the will left by Charles Hill. It is another piece of fraud. Charles Hill is my own mother's only brother. When he left my mother's house, he left under very serious trouble, for he had stabbed a man and had to keep in hiding until he could leave. If he had been caught it would have gone hard with him. When he left we were not allowed to call him by his own name. "When he left he told my mother he would never be known by the name of Bath. He went away under the name of Charles Hill. He was heard from the last time at San Francisco. He still kept the name of Charles Hill. He signed his name to all letters, Charles Hill. The lawyers know all about it. My uncle was Samuel S. Bath. I would like to go to California if I were able, but I am so tired I can hardly write and I have no grit left. "I wish Mr. Clark would tell some good lawyers about this case. We had a lawyer by the name of Freeman, but we heard he was doing nothing for our case. They own that we have a good case. Our lawyer went to California and they gave him hope that we were all right. The reason we took the case up was that we knew our uncle was under that name, but his right name is Samuel S. Bath. He carried a lot of money away with him. He always had money. The woman in New York is a fraud."</em> (9 Sep 1903 Los Angeles Times (Los Angeles, CA) p. A5)
<p>
He may be the "Samuel L. Bath" who appears in the 1860 census for San Jose, Santa Clara Co. CA. In that entry he is identified as having been born ca. 1824 in VA and a carpenter. He may also be the "Samuel S. Bath” born ca. 1825 who served in the First Battalion of the Nevada Calvary, on the side of the Union during the Civil War.

<a name="five"><strong>5. Benjamin<sup>2</sup> BATH</strong> (<a href="#one">John</a><sup>1</sup>). He was born ca. 1825. According to the estate notice mentioned above, his relatives had reason to believe he left the state of Virginia ca. 1845, if not earlier.

<a name="six"><strong>6. Jane Madison<sup>2</sup> BATH</strong> (<a href="#one">John</a><sup>1</sup>). She was born ca 1831 in VA. A descendant (Susan Hardwicke) has confirmed her middle name was Madison. According to an inscription on a grave marker, she died on 4 Jan 1874 and was buried on the same day in the Shockoe Cemetery, Richmond, VA.
<p>
Jane Madison married <strong>William Bennett COOK</strong>, son of Alban S. and Sarah (Sally) nee Goode Cook, on 14 Oct 1850 in Richmond, Henrico Co. VA. (Here's what may represent a <a href="janebath.html">photograph</a> of the couple that could have been taken on their wedding day. It is unclear that the William B. and Jane M. Cook in this photograph are our relatives.) He was born ca. 1830 and ran an iron foundry in Richmond. He died on 13 Jan 1893 and was buried on 14 Jan 1893 in the Shockoe Cemetery, Richmond, VA.

<p>
NEWSPAPER ACCOUNT: <em>"Richmond as a Manufacturing City: IRON WORK AND MACHINERY. SNYDER & IRBY, W. B. COOK & CO., AND JAMES D. BROWNE... PHOENIX FOUNDRY. The iron works of this significant name were founded by 1853 by Lowndes & Cook. They have been three times destroyed by fire- in 1856, in 1860, and at the evacuation in 1865. Before the war a large business was done here in iron verandahs, and all kinds of wrought iron and ornamental work for buildings. In 1861, the senior partner of the old firm, Mr. Lowndes, died, and since that time the business has been carried on by Mr. Wm. B. Cook, who has made a specialty to some extent of casting iron fronts and other architectural iron works. Before the war all of the castings of this kind in use here came from York, Pa., and other points north. Since 1865 work of this description has been done as well and as cheaply here, and Mr. Cook has sent a great deal of it South. Among other items we note sixty verrandahs sent to the southern States. Mr. Cook is now filling large orders from this city and elsewhere. He has just finished a handsome and substantial front for the fine new store corner of 15th and Cary streets and the vaults and gratings for the same. He built the vaults of all the banks in Richmond except one, and has now on hand contracts for eleven iron fronts for buildings in various parts of the city, including the proposed handsome residence of Mr. Watts, corner of Marshall and 11th streets, and several fine stores on Main street. He was contractor for the iron work of the Atlantic Hotel, in Norfolk, one of the handsomest structures in the whole southern country. The Phoenix Foundry is located on 8th street, between Main and Franklin."</em>
<p>
CITY DIRECTORY ENTRY: <em>"PHOENIX FOUNDRY-WILLIAM B. COOK. It is only your shallow man who believes in luck-who limits his faith to the ruling of a star or the casting of a planet. The laws of gravity, of chemistry, of botany, and the other natural laws, are not more fixed and certain in their operation than those who push their way up the plane of social and rational life, and there develop their influence in the struggle which every man makes in life, from the boy's game of play up to the crowning act of individual achievement in work. The sublime faith that believes in the stars-that looks up and out upon the deep-vaulted night, and tries hard to formulate a faith that all men can accept and rationally founded-may be admired by us for the grandeur and vastness of the problems it seeks to solve; but a little reason, not too shallow or superficial in quality, will soon bring us back to the more rational basis of cause and effect, the same arithmetic of which may be accurately computed as the threads of an even web. Law is the basis of everything, and although it works by invisible hands and feet, it treads steadily in one path, and brings out the uniform result. The lucky man is the one who perceives the chance of success, and seizes it at the right moment to make the success his own. He may be thwarted time and time again by adverse or unforeseen contingencies, such as no proper forecast, can effectually guard against; but a resolute faith in cause and effect in the industrial dogma that <u>something comes from something and nothing comes from nothing</u>, will bring him out successfully in the end. The owner of the Phoenix Foundry, Mr. William B. Cook, is a happy exemplification of the correctness of these reflections. He is a hard worker, and has had some hard rubs with "Adverse and unforeseen contingencies." He has been burnt out no less than three times in twenty-five years, but by dint of perseverance and the best of all personal qualities--<u>pluck</u>--he has risen each time, if not Phoenix-like, from the ashes of a previous establishment, yet like a resolute and determined man, who, when one chance fails him, is ready, nothing daunted, to strike for another. With him, <u>work is victory</u>. He takes no chances at luck, and consequently draws no blanks. Each blast of the forge, and each blow of the hammer, is what he has faith in, and leaves the rest to fortune. There are larger and more imposing establishments in Richmond, but his political economy is not to cut the throat of their competition, but to establish his own. No man is prouder of the prosperity of Richmond, arising from the other and larger establishments, than the energetic and public-spirited owner of the Phoenix Works. He seeks to share only in hte general prosperity, and demands patronage only as he may show himself worthy of it. The Phoenix Foundry is on the east side of eighth street, between Franklin and Main. Prior to November, 1871, it was run by Messrs. Cook & Viles, but since that time Mr. Cook has been the sole propreitor. He employs a large force and turns out a large variety of general castings, besides manufacturing iron railings, balconies, verandahs, columns, caps, sills, vault doors and frames, and all kinds of iron work for buildings. In fact, about everything this side of the line of Architectural iron work is successfully turned out in his establishment. His building is a large three-story brick, on Eighth above Main, with the foundry in the rear of it, and two stories above for machinery, woodwork, and pattern loft. He has recently completed and put up the large and commodious burglar & fireproof safe vault, in the new banking house of Messrs. Issacs, Taylor and Williams, on the corner of Thirteenth & Main Streets, which is said to be the largest safe ever manufactured south of "Mason and Dixon's line." Whether this be so or not, it is certainly large enough to satisfy and one that what our home institutions cannot do in the way of manufacturing mammoth safes, need not be sought for elsewhere. Mr. Cook is also constructing iron fronts for buildings, and doing not a little to the architectural taste and beauty of our city. The iron work for St. Mark's Church (Episcopal) is from his establishment, as well as numerous verandahs, balconies, railings, etc., of iron, put up during the past two or three years in different parts of the city. The iron work to the new office building of the Gas Works at Rocketts, with fine iron verandah and steps, was furnished by Mr. Cook. He has lately filled orders for Norfolk, for points in North and South Carolina, and other parts of the South, and he is confident he can compete, in quality and style of work, as well as in price, with any similar establishment in this or any other city. Mr. Cook has had an experience of twenty-five years and upwards at the business in which he is now engaged. Born in an adjoining county, and coming to Richmond when he was a mere boy, he has spent his apprenticeship and whole business among us. He has had, as we have before intimated, some pretty severe rebuffs of fortune; but he has come out every time with a resolution to strike ten blows for success where he had only struck five before. Starting first as a partner of Barnes & Co., he was afterwards of the company of Lownes & Cook, then of Cook & Viles, and now has the Phoenix Foundry as his own-- a foundry appropriately named from the circumstances already referred to, that on three several occasions he has seen his different establishments reduced to ashes. Such business energy and capacity as he has shown, and such faith in his work as the means of ultimate triumph, entitled him to a liberal if not generous share of public patronage..."</em>[RICHMOND DIRECTORY 1873-74 (xx appendix)]

MARRIAGE NOTICE: <em>"ROMANCE IN THE WEDDING. Miss Lelia Houston of Richmond Married in Washington. J. HUGHES [sic] BRETT THE GROOM. The Pretty Artist Never Told of Her Engagement. THE THIRMANN-TAYLOR NUPTIALS. A Great Concourse of Friends Crowd St. Paul 's Church to Witness the Ceremony. The Bride Radiant. Other Marriages. A wedding which contained many of the elements of romance took place in Washington, D.C. on Monday last, one of the principals in the affair being Miss Lelia Houston, the only daughter of Mr. A.C. Houston, the well-known builder of this city, who resides at "Welburn," the beautiful country home, just outside the corporate limits.  The happy groom was Mr. J. [sic] Hughes Brett, who is the son of a wealthy cotton-buyer and merchant of Georgia, but who now holds a profitable position in one of the Government departments at Washington. During the past year Miss Houston had made a number of trips to Washington where she had relatives, and during one of her visits she met Mr. Brett. It was a case of love at first sight on his part and she soon learned to return his affection. The engagement followed, but it was not announced to any but the relatives and closest friends of the two, and the announcement of the marriage will be read with great surprise by those here who know the bride. The wedding was quietly celebrated at the home of the bride's relatives in Washington, her family being represented by one of her brothers. After the event, Mr. and Mrs. Brett went on a wedding trip, and on their return will reside in Washington. Mrs. Brett is one of the prettiest of Richmond's many beautiful girls. She is an artist of decided ability as many pictures which she has painted will attest."</em> (13 Jan 1898)

Interment will follow at Greenview Memorial Park, 3657 Old Chisholm Road, Florence. The body will lie in state one hour prior to the service. Mr. Ingram was a native of Ashland, Alabama, and attended Howard College (now Samford University), in Birmingham where he starred on the varsity basketball team and was a member of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. He was a decorated military veteran, having served with great distinction as an aviator in the U.S. Navy from 1941-1950. His military career included service in the European and Asian Theaters during World War II, and over one hundred flights as part of the Berlin Airlift that brought relief to two million residents of Berlin after the war. Mr. Ingram retired from the Navy with the rank of Lieutenant Commander. Following his military service and additional studies at Tulane University and the University of Tennessee, Mr. Ingram worked at Reynolds Metals Company headquarters in Richmond, Virginia, where he met and married his loving wife, Jeannette. Mr. Ingram, his wife, and their young son later moved to Florence where he continued his career with Reynolds Metals as a transportation analyst. In 1971, Mr. Ingram was elected by his peers in the transportation industry to serve as president of the North Alabama Traffic Club. After his retirement in 1981, Mr. Ingram and his wife continued to enjoy traveling and golf. Mr. Ingram and his wife were long-standing active members of Westminster Presbyterian Church. Mr. Ingram received a great deal of enjoyment from his family, his church, golf, reading novels, and following Atlanta Braves baseball. He was a quiet but loving husband, father, and grandfather, and he possessed a remarkable inner strength that never faded. He was a hero to his son. In 2009, Mr. Ingram moved to the Birmingham area to be closer to his family. His greatest delights were his son, James, and grandson, Jay. Mr. Ingram was predeceased by his wife, Jeannette, his parents, Rev. James L. and Cordelia Garrett Ingram, and his two brothers, James C. Ingram and Herman L. Ingram. He is survived by his son and daughter-in-law, James Dennis and Laurie Ingram, Birmingham, his grandson, James Dennis Ingram, Jr., Auburn, and six loving nieces and nephews. The family would like to express their deep appreciation to Sunrise Ridge Assisted Living Facility in Trussville, Alabama, and to the doctors and staff of St. Vincent's East Hospital, especially the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit, for their care and compassion during Mr. Ingram's illness. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests that donations be made in Mr. Ingram's memory to the Westminster Presbyterian Memorial Fund, 1520 Rickwood Road, Florence, Alabama 35630."</em>
