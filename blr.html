These are tintypes of two young girls. The third was labelled "Caroline Rudge Coble", and I believe she one and the same as the youngest girl in the first two photos, which leads me to suspect the older girl is her older sister, Bettie Louise Rudge. They were found among a set of photos in the <a href="coblealbum.html">Coble Family Photo Album</a>.
