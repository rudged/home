Jerome, Comissioner, being all of said lot remaining after conveying a part to my daughter, Ethel Josephine Rudge, the lot herein devised being ninety feet front and extending back from College Street One hundred and sixty feet to Ethel Josephine Rudge's lot; and I also bequeath to my daughter, Martha Fletcher Adams, my piano now in my residence in Monroe, North Carolina, and I fix the value of the lot and piano herein devised and bequeathed to Martha Fletcher at the sum of two thousand dollars, for which she shall account in the final settlement and distribution of my estate.	3.
