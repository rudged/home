(p. 213); <li>SOMERSETSHIRE: "The name of Rugg was represented six centuries ago by Le Rug and Le Rugge in Oxfordshire and Kent (H.R.). Ruegg is an occasional form of the name" (p. 354); <li>WORCESTERSHIRE: "The family of RUDGE was well known in Evesham in the 17th century, and the Rudges have remained influential Evesham townsmen up to the present time; no less than five mayors bore the name of Rudge between 1661 and 1731, and of these four bore the Christian name of William (M. and T.)"
