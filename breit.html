<cite>"My daughter Constance and her husband were in Europe in October and enjoyed it very much. She went last year too. They rent a car for the duration of their stay and travel by themselves to places where some of the tourist groups do not go. She traveled to Billebache to find out about our great grandfather [Johann Friedrich Breitkreutz] but the town had no Protestants (all Catholics) so that wasn't us.  The Burgermeister was very nice and said there were four other Billebaches, all little villages, so when she went this year she went to these villages. The people were very nice but so many of the church records were destroyed during the war so she was out of luck. Constance has a reason for thinking it was near Hanover. Anyway there goes our family tree. Our grandfather [Christian Friedrich Wilhelm Breitkreutz] had money inherited from his mother. He brought Uncle Hennigs, Uncle Blumberg and Mike Finders also our great grandmother Finder [Maria ? Finder] to America. He paid their expenses and a winter in Watertown before migrating to Lake Mills, north (of  lake) end. The log cabin that the Stelses lived in was built by Grandpa B. Finders went on to Nebraska later on I understand. This about all I really know and it was told to me by our grandfather when he was living with us one year.

<p>
<a name="one"><strong>1. Johann Friedrich<sup>1</sup> BREITKREUTZ</strong>. He was presumably born in Pomerania and died between 10 Feb 1839 and 18 May 1858, the day his "widow" died (see record of her death below). Our knowledge of him comes from a series of baptism records for his children (below) and two others in which he appears as a sponsor or god parent.  
<p>
Johann Friedrich appears as a sponsor in a record of a baptism for Wilhemine Radke, the daughter of Friedrich Wilhelm Radke and Maria Elizabeth (BREITKREUTZ), that occurred on 24 Dec 1826 in Billerbeck, Pomerania.  Friedrich Wilhelm Radke was a town official in Billerbeck. I conjecture that Maria Elizabeth was related to Johann Friedrich BREITKREUTZ because she is listed as a sponsor at two of the three baptisms of his children (below). In all likelihood she was his sister, as Johann's wife Regina is listed as a sponsor of one of her children on 2 May 1824. On a more speculative note, Johann Friedrich and Maria Elizabeth may be children of the Cristogh BREITKREUTZ who died in Billerbeck on 14 Apr 1831 at the age of 79 years 3 months and 2 days. 
<p>

<p>
Johann Friedrich also appears as a sponsor in a record of a baptism for Hanne Sophiee Brizig, the daughter of Johann Friedrich Brizig and his wife Dorothea Sophiee Roloff, that occurred on 10 Feb 1839. This is the last record that definitively refers to him among the Billerbeck church records. 
<p>
Johann Friedrich married <strong>Regine KREKLOW</strong>, before 1824 and presumably in Pomerania. She was born ca. 1790, presumably in Pomerania. She died on 18 May 1858 in Billerbeck, Pomerania, Prussia, Germany and was buried on 21 May 1858 in Billerbeck, Pomerania, Prussia, Germany. The record of her death refers to her as a "housekeeper."

<p>
"Arbeitsman" (worker) Breitkreutz is listed as a sponsor at the baptism of Dorothea Sophie August, daughter of Johann Breizig and his wife Dorothea on 1 Aug 1841 in Billerbeck, Pomerania, Prussia. Although this may refer to his father, Johann Friedrich, I am inclined to think this is a reference to Christian Friedrich Wilhelm, because he is described as "Arbeitsman Breitkreutz on yet another record where his wife is also present as a sponsor.
<p>
He appears as a sponsor in a number of baptism records that took place in Billerbeck: on 1 Feb 1846 at the baptism for Ernestina Augusta Brizig, the daughter of Johann Friedrich Brizig and his wife Dorothea Sophiee Roloff; on 13 Sep 1846 at the baptism for Gwistius Johanne Link, the daughter of Michael Link and his wife Gwistius Masse; on 13 Mar 1853 at the baptism for Julius Herman Muller, the son of Christian Friedrich Muller and his wife Johanne Christine Diekhoff; and on 17 Dec 1855 at the baptism for Heinrich Wilhelm Hottshalk, the son of Carl Friedrich Hottshalk and his wife Wilhelmine Radke [d. of Maria Elizabeth BREITKREUTZ Radke].
<p>
He married <strong>Johanna Caroline FINDER</strong>, daughter of Johan Friedrich FINDER & Maria GORKA, on 5 Jun 1848 in Augustwald, Pomerania, Germany. She was born on 1 Feb 1823 in Augustwald, Pomerania, Germany. She died of multiple sarcoma on 24 Jul 1907 in Lake Mills, Jefferson Co. WI and was buried on 25 Jul 1907 in the Rock Lake Cemetery, Lake Mills, Jefferson Co. WI. She was a member of the Moravian Church, Lake Mills. Information about her ancestry is located <A HREF="finder.html">here</a>. Here's a <A HREF="c2-16.html">photograph</a> of Wilhelm and his wife.
<p>
William and his family migrated from Germany using money from his mother's estate on Sept 29, 1858. He is listed as arriving on 4 Jan 1859 through the port of NY, age 31, both parents are listed as born in Germany; With him are listed his wife(?) Jane (33) and children Henry(9), William (7) and Harman (2). Also listed is a Sophia Finder(62 yrs old). The ship is called the Aristedes and left from Bremerhaven. (From German Immigrants, pp. 350-1).
<p>
I have located an 1862 deed record recording his purchase of land in Lake Mills. A later land deal involving him is referred to as occurring 17 Feb 1865 (v. 46 of Deeds, p. 169) that included 54.93 acres of land.
<p>
According to a letter from the Office Administrator of the Moravian Church at Lake Mills, Jefferson Co. WI, he and his wife became members of the church on 8 Apr 1887.

FIFTIETH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY: <cite>"Married Fifty Years. The celebration of the golden wedding of Mr. and Mrs. Wm. Breitkreutz took place at their residence in this village on Sunday last at 2:30 p. m., attended by children, grandchildren and near friends. The relatives present were the three sons, Henry, William and Herman, and their families, and the only daughter, Mrs. G. Helpap and Mr. Helpap, a sister and Mr. Carl Finder, a brother of Mrs. Breitkreutz, and Mrs. Finder, Mr. and Mrs. August Henning, Mr. and Mrs. Carl Blumberg, Mr. and Mrs. Kuhl and daughter Elmira and sixteen grandchildren. Mr. Fred Finder and Mr. Ernest Wolf were also guests. Rev. Wm. Strohmeier delivered an appropriate and touching address, and Rev. Theo. Sonderman distributed the gifts, among which were a gold-headed ebony cane, a present to Mr. Breitkreutz, and an umbrella with gold-mounted hand piece and a pair of gold spectacles, a gift to Mrs. Breitkreutz. The celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the marriage of these elderly people was planned by their children, and at an appointed hour the party came upon Mr. and Mrs. Breitkreutz in the quiet of their home as unexpectedly as roses in the summertime, a perfect surprise, which, however, proved to be a most happy one, filling their hearts with gladness. At five o'clock p. m. supper was served and the happy guests vied with each other in filling the hour with as much joy as possible to those who had reached their fiftieth mile-stone in their journey of life together and were now permitted to look into the faces and hear the happy voices of so many of their children and grandchildren, while they themselves still enjoy a goodly measure of health and strength of body and mind.  The hours were made happy by reminiscences of the fifty years passed until the hour of 9 p. m., when the guests took their departure, gladdened with the thought that they had been instrumental in adding to the joys of two honest devoted hearts."</cite> (Lake Mills Spike 9 Jun 1898). Here's a <A HREF="c2-15.html">photograph</a> of the whole family taken at this celebration.

OBITUARY "August Heinrich Breitkreutz, the son of William and Hannah (Finder) Breitkreutz, was born at Billerbeck, Pomerania, Germany, March 22, 1849. He came to this country, with his parents, when only 9 years of age. The family settled near Newville, Wis., about the year 1858. Here he grew up to manhood and was a useful helper on the farm of his father from earliest youth. He received his secular training in the district's public school and in religion he was brought up in the Lutheran faith, a church of that denomination being located near-by.  On October 26, 1876 he was married to Miss Minna Augusta Gritzmacher, near Deerfield, Wis. This union was blessed with five children, all of whom survive the departure of their aged father. The family joined the Moravian church, in 1887, and remained in fellowship with the Lake Mills congregation, until 1901; for in October of that year the family moved to the vicinity of Shopiere. Near the little village of Tiffany he secured a farm, which he managed until advanced age induced him to retire in the city of Shopiere, in the year 1918. Nearly every winter, since the year 1923, he and his wife went to Tomah, Florida to live part of the time with their married daughter and part time with his son, who also lived at Tampa. Considering the age at which he had arrived, his health was in remarkable condition, so that, even last fall, he, together with his wife, could again, make the trip to Tampa, Florida, where he spent the winter with his daughter. Recently they returned to Shopiere, where they were making arrangements to settle in a house, which they had recently secured, for their own abode, in which to retire. But, alas! on last Tuesday he met with an accident under a Ford car, while moving it out of the shed. Internal injuries were sustained from the accident, from which he never recovered. On Thursday morning, April 2, 1931, at 4:15, he passed into his eternal rest at the home of his daughter, Mrs. A. Meyer, having attained the age of 82 years and 9 days. His departure is mourned by his, now, sorrowing widow; one brother, Mrs. Herman Breitkreutz; one sister, Mrs. Emilie Helpop; three sons, William of Clinton, Wis.; Bernard of Tiffany, Wis.; and Aaron of Janesville, Wis.; two daughter, Ida, now Mrs. A. F. Feier of Shopiere, Wis.; and Erma, now Mrs. R. J. Weirick of Tampa, Florida; also 10 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren. Many other more distant relatives and friends will continue to cherish his memory as one who was loved by his own and honored in the community. Funeral services were held at the residence of his daughter, Mrs. A. F. Meier at Shopiere, Wis., last Saturday at 11 a. m., and at the Moravian church, in Lake Mills, at 2 p. m. , the Rev. H. Richter, assisted by Rev. O. E. Reidenbach and Rev. A. Ryan, officiating. Interment was made on the family lot on the Rock Lake cemetery." (Lake Mills Leader 9 Apr 1931)

OBITUARY - "Mrs. Henry Breitkreutz Buried Saturday. Minna Augusta Gritzmacher, daughter of William and Ernestine (Lehmpohl) Gritzmacher, was born in the Town of Deerfield on October 21, 1859. She spent her girlhood and younger days in her home community attending the public school and receiving her religious instructions at the German Lutheran Church of Waterloo, Wis., where she was likewise confirmed. She was united in marriage at the Waterloo Lutheran Church on October 26, 1876 with August Henry Breitkreutz of Newville, where the young couple made their home on a farm not far distant from the Newville Lutheran Church. Later on they moved to Lake Mills and on November 13, 1887 they united with the Lake Mills Moravian church in which their five children were baptized and received religious instruction later on. after leaving this community in 1901 for Shopiere, Wis., they were united with the Lutheran Church of Shopiere sometime after January 1, 1902. Here they spent the next 18 years on a large farm, later retiring to the town of Shopiere where her husband died on April 2, 1931. His funeral took place from the Moravian Church on April 4, 1931. She lived a long, useful life, enjoying her many old and new-formed friendships, both here around Lake Mills as well as at and around Shopiere. Her children and grandchildren, as well as her great-grandchildren were her joy, and she was privileged to live to see several generations grow up into useful, upright and honest citizens. She likewise appreciated the kindness and love shown to her in these last three weeks of illness. She passed away peacefully this last Thursday, Dec. 18 at 7:05 p. m. at the age of 82 years and 2 months, lacking three days. Five children remain, namely: Mrs. Ida Meyers of Beloit, Mrs. Irma Weirick of Milwaukee, William of Delavan, Bernhard of Shopiere, and Aaron of Janesville, as well as nine grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. The funeral was held Sunday, Dec. 21 at 1 p. m. from Shopiere and at 2:30 p. m. from the local Moravian Church. Interment was in Rock Lake Cemetery." (12-25-1944).

All her married life was spent on the farm where she died. Ten children came to bless their home, four of whom passed away some years ago. Last February Mrs. Breitkreutz was seized with a severe attack of the grippe, other complications developed which brought her to the brink of the grave. To the surprise of many she improved, for a time, but the disease made such inroads upon her health and general appearance that she appeared like a very aged person. Her health continued more or less precarious, sometimes being pretty good and again considerably worse. Last week, however, she felt exceptionally well, when suddenly last Friday morning she had a violent attack of coughing, followed by convulsions. Still, the worst was not expected. At midnight, however, the unseen messenger came and delivered her from all mortal ailments.  She is survived by her mother, who was unable to attend the funeral, her husband, five daughters and a son, and three married sisters, namely: Mrs. Fred C. Smith, of Duluth, Mrs. Emil Brunn, of Mellette, South Dakota, and Mrs. Dave Bowden, of Pardeeville, Wis.

OBITUARY - <cite>"SENO HERMAN KYPKE  Obituary, prepared and read by Rev. Reidenbach. Seno Herman, son of Frank and Caroline Neupert Kypke, was born August 21, 1883, in the town of Waterloo, Wisconsin. In 1888 he came with his parents to Lake Mills. On the third of April, 1898, he was confirmed in the Moravian church here and ever since remained a member there in good standing. As his pastor I have known Seno for seventeen years. In June 1902 he graduated with his class in our High School. After graduating he entered the employ of George Bruns and continued in that store till very recently. The last seven years he was one of the partners in the Lake Mills Hardware Co. In the evening of October 6, 1910 he was married by the Rev. O. E. Reidenbach to Miss Frances Breitkreutz at the home of her grandmother, Mrs. Jeanette Young. He is dressed today with the same clothes as he was that happy evening. Oh! the changes, the great changes that take place in our earthly career. Who could have foreseen this sad event on that wedding night? This sickness, tuberculosis, began last February. From that time till the end he was confined to his bed or to an invalid chair. He knew his end was coming and said it would be easy for him to go. All he would have to do would be to let go. He passed away early Wednesday morning, January 2, 1918 at half past four o'clock, aged 34 years, 4 months and 12 days. He leaves to mourn his loss his wife, his parents, two brothers, and two sisters.  Those many long weeks and months of kindly ministrations are over. His chair he needs no more. Relief has come. He is no longer a sufferer, for he has gone home to Him of whom he read in his Bible and of whom he had heard all his life. Everybody knew Seno. Everybody liked him. He was so genuinely friendly, so fair and square, so honest and upright. When opportunities offered to make unfair gains he refused them. He could treat no one unjustly. He would take unfair advantage of no one. He wanted a fair and square deal, and he always gave it. Lake Mills has lost a most estimable citizen. His near acquaintances have lost a friend, good and true. His wife has lost a loving, attentive husband, patient in suffering. His parents, brothers and sisters have lost a son and a brother whose memory everybody honors. And now may we take to heart the word of the Holy Writ found in Psalm 90, verse 12."</cite> (Brochure provided at Memorial Service)

Mr. Wodke often said that although there were opportunities to work in larger communities, Lake Mills was his home and he never wished to live or serve elsewhere. His interest in and love for his hometown were evident in his many civic activities. The community itself gained his attention through service on various committees, the Red Cross, the Light and Water Commission, Chamber of Commerce, former Lake Mills Men's Club, and president of the Park Board. The local high school and its athletic programs profited from his interest. He was a member of the Congregational Church. Always concerned with the business climate of Lake Mills, he was instrumental in encouraging new industries to locate here, and was a charter member of the Rotary Club.

Associated article, same newspaper "The honorary 33rd Degree in Masonry has been bestowed upon three Lake Mills men: the late Ora A. Wodke, R. N. Seward, this city, and E. S. Dodge, now living in Arizona... With the passing of Ora A. Wodke, another of Lake Mills' most highly esteemed senior citizens, the community has lost a very loyal and dear friend. He had an unusually deep feeling and concern for this community in which he spent his entire lifetime--86 fruitful and happy years. Lake Mills was "home" (the dearest place on earth) to Ora Wodke and, in his estimation, no other city in this wide, wide, world could "hold a candle" to this fair city on the shores of beautiful Rock Lake. We are certain that Lake Mills is a better community because Ora Wodke lived in our midst."</cite> (Lake Mills Leader, November 23 1966)

When MW & Co. built a place in Menands, Uncle Ralph was transferred there. I don't really know much more about him. He was a wonderful person with a nice sense of humor and was forever correcting my grammar."</cite> His daughter, Beverly Anne COOK recalls that Ralph and Laura roomed in the same apartment building, with the male and female tenants segregated.
<p>
According to Ruby Mae Breitkreutz Graffunder, Ralph came to work for Montgomery Wards in St. Paul, MN after Studebaker in NY City went out of business in 1924; she also recalls that he left St. Paul for Menands, NY when Montgomery Wards opened its new plant there and offered him a pay raise if he would consent to a transfer.

The capacity of the chapel was taxed by the large gathering of pupils, teachers, and patrons of the Dubois school. Youth and age shared the grief of members of her family who had come from Lake Mills, Wis., when her sudden illness became critical. Following a vocal selection by Mrs. E. S. Clark, Rev. Dr. Pittman in simple, direct manner interpreted what he called "the greatness of the human spirit" as it was exemplified in Miss Breitkreutz's life, service and influence. "She was in truth an ideal young woman," said the minister, "Illness, sorrow, disappointment, even death, could not destroy her courageous, patient, serene, unselfish, Christian spirit. Her unfailing concern for the well-being of others; her fidelity to ideals of personal living and public service as a teacher won the love and gratitude of a host of friends. The beauty and worth of her influence has left its impression on many in this city. We shall not forget or fail in our gratitude now that her work is done."

Even in a world which has grown accustomed to tragic news concerning its young men, the sudden death of Robert Breitkreutz was a great shock to his many friends and relatives. He was born November 26, 1916 in Lake Mills. His mother died in March 1919, and not long afterward he and his twin brother went to make their home with their aunt, Mrs. Frances Wodke. After completing grade school and high school in Lake Mills, he attended Carroll college, Waukesha, where he became a member of the Beta Phi Epsilon fraternity. His sophomore year he transferred to the University of Wisconsin, there majoring in chemistry, until his health forced him to give up his intended career. On April 7, 1940 he married Florence Wiehe, granddaughter of Mrs. Fannie K. Earl, at the Wesley Foundation in Madison. After spending several months in northern Wisconsin, they drove to California for the winter. Returning to the midwest in June, 1941, they settled in Chicago where he became associated with the F.W. Dodge Corporation as a statistician. The enjoyment he found in this new work, more than compensated for the chemical career which he had been compelled to give up. His son, James Robert, was born November 3, 1943, in Chicago, and was christened by the Rev. R. T. Wilkowske at the Methodist church in Lake Mills on December 26. On January 31, he and his wife and son moved into their newly-purchased home in Prospect Heights, Ill. Only a little more than a week later, on February 10, a recurrent attack of the heart ailment which had troubled him for so long, caused his death as he was on the way to the hospital. Funeral services were held Sunday at the Congregational church in Lake Mills with the Rev. A. H. Schoenfield officiating. Burial was in Rock Lake Cemetery. He is survived by his wife and son; his father of Groton, S.D.; a twin brother, Roger, S. 2C, U.S. Navy, Norman, Okla.; and three sisters, Rachel of Norfolk, Va; Mrs. Ruby Graffunder of Troy, N.Y…."</em> (Lake Mills Leader)

OBITUARY: <em>"LAKE MILLS - Charlotte J. Gestner, 88, formerly of Lake Mills, died Tuesday, July 10, 2007, at Holy Rosary Medical Center in Ontario, Ore., after unexpected medical complications while visiting her daughter. She was born in Lake Mills on March 8, 1919, daughter of Alfred and Charlotte (Degner) Breitkruetz [sic]. Following the death of her mother, her maternal grandparents, the William Degners, raised Charlotte. Charlotte graduated from Lake Mills High School in 1937 and married Robert W. Gestner in 1939. Charlotte attended Madison Area Technical College from 1964 to 1966, where she completed her studies to become a medical assistant. She worked at the Lake Mills Medical Center and Fort Atkinson Hospital. She went on to work at University Hospital in Madison where she gained a certificate in respiratory therapy. She had been a resident of Lake Mills from birth until moving to California in 1970. After living in Monterey for several years, she settled in San Jose where she worked at O'Connor Hospital as a respiratory therapist and at DeAnza College in the admissions office. Charlotte always had a zest for life and welcomed a challenge. Her travels took her to many places in the United States and in Europe. Class reunions were a must on her list of things to do so that she could visit close friends and classmates. At her 65th class reunion, she completed her second tandem skydive in Fort Atkinson. She was 83. The first skydive was at the age 72 in California. Her passion for gardening kept her busy and was enjoyed by many of the residents at her apartment complex. She became the “resident gardener.” Other adventures included such things as a ride-along with the San Jose Police and Fire departments, who gladly gave her an autographed T-shirt, which she wore proudly. Family, friends and keeping busy was Charlotte's recipe for life. Charlotte is survived by two children, Noel (Vonnie) Gestner of Lompoc, Calif., and Cheri Knutsen of Indian Valley, Idaho; her stepmother, Irene Breitkruetz of Omaha, Neb.; a stepsister, Mary Jane (Jeff) Loll of Omaha, Neb.; six grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. She is preceded in death by her mother and father; her former husband, Robert; a son, Donald Gestner; two sisters, Rachael Kelsey and Ruby Graffunder; and two brothers, Roger and Robert Breitkruetz. A private memorial will be held at a later date. "</em> (24 Jul 2007, Watertown Daily Times On-Line)
