This is a genealogy to one branch of the Wyss family, that migrated from Bucholterberg, Kanton Bern, Switzerland to Croton Dam, Newaygo Co. MI.
<p>
<i>"The family [<a href="#two">2. Niklaus Wyss</a>] raised bees and sold honeycomb. They also made 6-8# Swiss cheeses. He [<a href="#nine">9. Alfred Wyss</a>] liked the cheese made at home but not commercial Swiss cheese. They used powder to get holes in the cheese and had to watch the cow's diets to get the right taste. Could not put cloth jackets on cheese because it had to be salted over and over. Milk plus powder made lumps. Then you strain it through cloth and put weights on the molds. Then used a linen wrapper. Take out of the mold and keep in the cellar for six months. The family sold cheese. One of Alfred's brother's [<a href="#six">6. Friedrich Wyss</a>] was a cheese maker who went to Russia. He and his family lost everything in 1917. Alexander Wyss, a son, returned to Switzerland. The Grandparents, Bieri, both came from a village near Thun. Leo acted as an interpreter for his grandparents. Most Swiss were farmers with large families. The children were rented out to other farms. The only place to meet other children was at church, and we were German Methodists. Men and boys sat on one side and women and girls sat on the other. My cousins were Roths and Bieris. Fannie was my mother and when she died my father married Susannah. My sister, Esther, was very critical of everyone but she was interested in everyone's welfare. She brought Christmas presents to families who were poor. She did not spend on herself. My father built a Swiss chalet and rocks held the roof down. Our farm grew corn, potatoes, rye, oats. We were not good at farming."</i> [Random comments by Leo (Lionel Wenzel) Wyss transcribed his granddaughter, Pam Wyss Foster.]

<p>
In <a href="AWrec.html">"Some Early Days, as I Recall Them"</a> Alfred writes <cite>"I was born in Switzerland on October 10, 1870, and came to the United States in the spring of 1889. The first few years were spent in farming near Lowell, Michigan. When I first came to this country, I was not sure that I would remain here, but I  liked America and took out my citizenship papers on June 6, 1896, having decided to make this my future home. I did not like farming too well, and in 1899 obtained employment at a Cutter and Buggy factory in Lowell. One of the earliest telephones was installed in this factory, which was a source of curiosity to me, never having used one, and so I was rather amazed to be called to answer it one day. The call was from my good friend Anthony Kalliger, who was in charge of a small Hydro Plant on the Flat River just north of Lowell, and who wanted me to meet him at the plant as soon as convenient. So on a day in December, 1899, I kept my appointment with Anthony at the plant to hear that he was in need of an operator and had me in mind."</cite> His essay goes on to tell of his career as a hydro-electric operator in both Lowell and later Croton Dam.
<p>
Alfred migrated to the United States with a friend (Fred Wittenbach) via Le Havre, France aboard the ship La Champagne. He arrived at the port of New York on 18 Mar 1889. On the ship’s manifest he is identified as "Alfred Wiss", 18 years old, and a farmer from Switzerland. (Record found among New York Passenger Lists 1820-1957 (Microfilm M237, Line 17, List no. 303).
<p>
He first married <strong>Fannie BIERI</strong>, daughter of Johannes BIERI & Elizabeth ROTH, on 10 Oct 1891 in Grand Rapids, Kent Co. MI (Certified copy of marriage license, Kent Co. MI Marriage Records 1845-1927, Book 10, page 308, record no. 4594). Here’s a <a href=FannieBieri.html>photo</a> of a portrait of her.
<p>
Fannie was born ca. 1875. She was baptized on 14 Sep 1875 in Schangnau, Kanton Bern, Switzerland (LDS submitted record ""Bieri Family reg. by corresp. p. 206."). They apparently lived briefly in Grattan, Kent Co. MI, where they resided at the birth of their first child Otto before moving to Boston Township, Ionia Co. MI where their next three children were born. Alfred is consistently referred to as a farmer in all of these records. Fannie died of a fever on 16 Apr 1897 in Boston Township, Ionia Co. MI and was buried on 18 Apr 1897 in the Bailey Cemetery, Vergennes United Methodist Church, Lowell, Kent Co. MI.  On her death bed, she begged her sister Susanna to take care of her four children, in line with Swiss tradition.

Alfred and his family moved at least once while they lived in the vicinity of Lowell, Kent Co. (<em>"FALLASBURG... Alfred Wyss has moved his family to the old Moye farm near the plant."</em> (15 Dec 1904 Lowell Ledger (Lowell, MI) p. 3).) In November of 1907 the family migrated in connection with Alfred's new job at the Croton power plant to Croton Dam, Newaygo Co. MI. (<em>"Alfred Wyss was in town this week moving his household goods and family to Croton, Newaygo county, where he has charge of the big power plant of the Grand Rapids Muskegon Power company. During their long residence in Lowell, Mr. and Mrs. Wyss have made many friends who will wish them continued prosperity in their new home. Mr. Wyss regrets leaving Lowell and is satisfied he can find no better place to trade or live. In fact, he says, "Lowell is all right.""</em> (14 Nov 1907 Lowell Ledger (Lowell, MI) p. 5).)

OBITUARY- <cite>"OBITUARY. After an illness of five weeks Mrs. Alfred Wyss passed away Friday afternoon, October 22. Susanna Bieri, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John Bieri, was born in Schwarzenegg, Switzerland, January 15, 1867. At the age of at the age of 16 [1883] she came with her parents to America and settled in Lowell. A few years later she became a nurse, and for several years served as a Deaconess nurse in the Wayne Hospital, Detroit.. In 1898 she was united in marriage to Alfred Wyss. The family moved to Croton eight years ago [1907] and since then the loving sympathy and ever ready helpfulness of the departed have made her a necessary factor in the community life. Her presence will be missed by many, for she was loved by all who knew her. Taken ill the latter part of September, Mrs. Wyss gradually grew weaker until her death last Friday. The body was taken to Lowell, where the funeral services were held in the German M. E. church at 10 o'clock Sunday morning. Interment was made in the Bailey cemetery. Mrs. Wyss leaves a husband, son, four daughters, two sisters and two brothers, besides a host of other relatives and friends who mourn her loss.  IN MEMORIAM. In life's golden age is she taken, Leaving many a sad heart to miss her. Thus early is called to account For a noble life to her Master. For she ever loved to be helpful And sunshine she cast around her, By her ever ardent longing To do the will of her Master. Thus hath she lived and thus did she pass With no thought, but to duty united. May her ashes rest in sweet peace hence on earth. Her spirit abide with the angels."</cite>  Second obituary <cite>"Once more death has entered our midst and taken a loved neighbor and friend. Susanna Bieri, wife of Alfred Wyss and daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John Bieri, was born in Scharganegg, Switzerland, January 15, 1867. At the age of 16 she came with her parents to America and settled in Lowell, Mich. She became a nurse at the Deaconess hospital in Detroit. In 1898 she was united in marriage with Alfred Wyss; the family moved to Croton eight years ago. Mrs. Wyss will be missed in the home, in the community, and in the church. Her heart's interest was in her Master's work. She said she was the Lord's and whatever was His will was hers; if His will to spare her or take her, it was alright. She had such loving communion with the Lord and He saw fit to take her. What is our loss is her eternal gain. She leaves to mourn her loss a husband, one son, four daughters, two sisters, two brothers, and other relatives. Funeral services were held in the M. E. church at Lowell. Burial in the Lowell cemetery. Thus ends a devoted life."</cite> Third obituary <cite>"Everyone here mourns the death of Mrs. Alfred Wyss. She was an earnest worker in God's vineyard and one who could ill be spared. Many of her kind deeds will live long in memory."</cite> Fourth obituary <cite>"MRS. ALFRED WYSS. In Memory. Back in the forest, one day, a little spring forced its way through a crevice in the rocks and wound its course merrily down to the river, in the valley below. The song of its waters, rippling over the pebbles, was restful music in those silent places. The wild flowers bloomed along its banks, nourished by its grateful moisture carried about on the changing breeze. The wild life of the woods and the air drank of its cool waters and was refreshed. Whereso-e'er it passed there was rejoicing in nature. Then came a day when the source of the spring failed and its music was heard no more. The wild flowers hung their heads and in that part of the forest nature was sad. As with the little spring, which had fulfilled its humble mission, doing good in nature, so with our deceased friend, Mrs. Wyss-a simple quiet soul. She fulfilled her mission in life by devotion to her family, by working for her church and by lending a helping hand to the sick and the sorrowing. Sadness follows her passing beyond, in the little community where she was part of the daily life, and her gentle ways and kindly heart will keep her in our memory. May she rest in peace. Croton, Mich. October 25, 1915. W. A. T."</cite>; Fifth obituary<em>"Mrs. Alfred Wyss of Croton Buried Here Sunday.

<p>
In a letter from Olive Wyss Bracker (Alfred's daughter) to her half sister Lena Anne Wyss Rudge (21 Jan ) she writes--<cite>" I can remember when Dad heard that his sister Anne was gone. He felt so badly. Also can remember when some one wrote him, I don't know who, that his mother was very poorly and if he was going to keep his promise to her, he would have to come soon. You see, when he left Switzerland [1906], he promised her he would be back. Well your mother [Susanna Bieri Wyss] thought he should go, and helped make it possible for him to go. Grandma and Grandpa had $300 from her, but were not in a position to pay it back, and she wanted him to use that money to go. So actually she made it possible for him to go."</cite>

Alfred was one of the original trustees of the Zion Church Methodist Episcopal Church, German Congregation, Lowell, Kent Co. Michigan. He is listed as a trustee on Warranty Deed of land in Lowell (29 Jan 1897); and in a signatory of Mortgage to Lowell State Bank, he again is identified as a trustee (19 Jul 1897). He was also a member of the local school board for a total of fifty years.

<p>
RECOLLECTIONS: <em>"...I don't want to leave Lowell without commenting on my older brother, Otto, who died of appendicitis shortly after we left Lowell. He seemed to be a sort of a young Edison having built electric motors, electrical heaters, and all kinds of mechanical devices. He used to go around trading his invention for cameras, guns, and whatever else he needed. He could load his own shotgun shells and was an exceptional photographer in his day, developing from plates and having his own dark room. Years later, I met an old classmate of Otto's at a golf course in Pontiac. He told me that Otto used to repair all of the broken laboratory equipment at the high school when he was in ninth grade. Otto was good in school..."</em> (from <a href="growingupswiss.html">"Growing Up Swiss"</a> by his brother Leo Wenzel Wyss, p. 8)

Well my mother's father was the superintendent of that dam, Alfred Wyss. (At the time there was no hotel in Croton Dam and Alfred Wyss used to entertain visitors to the dam, so anyone who visited the dam was put up in Alfred Wyss' house)  And so when Dad was there doing his electrical research he obviously met the sisters, including my mother who was back at home during the summer from college.  They drove back to Pittsfield and got married there, where William Jerome Rudge, jr. was staying at Mrs. Richie's boarding house while employed by General Electric there."</cite> (Recollection of his son, William Jerome Rudge III).
