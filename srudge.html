<a name="one"><strong>1. William<sup>1</sup> RUDGE.</strong>. He married <strong>Isobel COOPER</strong> on 7 Nov 1742 in the parish of Harborne, Stafford, England (LDS Batch no. M085732 Sheet 00, Source no. 0428999). 
<p>
Isobel may be the Isabella Rhudge who was buried on 29 Jan 1797 OR the Isabella Rhudge who was buried on 9 Mar 1804 at the Smethwick Chapelry, (Old Smethwick Church), Smethwick, Stafford, England (Registers of the Old Church Smethwick v. 1 & 2, p. 82, 87). 
<p>
William may be the one of three William Rhudges who were buried on 20 Apr 1774, 20 Jun 1777, or 14 May 1805 at the Smethwick Chapelry, (Old Smethwick Church), Smethwick, Stafford, England (Registers of the Old Church Smethwick v. 1 & 2, p. 38, 39, 88).

William and Isobel had the following children:

<a name="two"><strong>2. Anne<sup>2</sup> RUDGE</strong>(<a href="#one">William</a><sup>1</sup>). She was born ca. 1745 and baptized the daughter of William and Isabel Rudge on 24 Jan 1745 at the Smethwick Chapelry (Old Smethwick Church), Smethwick, Stafford, England (Registers of the Old Church Smethwick v. 1 & 2, p. 6).

Samuel married someone named Elizabeth ca. 1775. I suspect it may be Elizabeth <strong>CARR</strong>, daughter of Thomas and Hannah Carr, as the below record is the only marriage record I have been able to find of a Samuel Rudge in the appropriate time period and Birmingham is relatively nearby.

After Thomas died, Jane migrated with her children to New York City ca. 1865 according to census records. She lived for a time in Brooklyn ca. 1875, but ultimately wound up in Ridgewood, Bergen, New Jersey. She died some time after the 1880 census.
<p>
STORY ABOUT THE FAMILY: <i>"Jane's husband Thomas was a "draper" in England. He apparently suffered some sort of stroke or heart attack and was taken home and the doctor sent for. According to my father, the doctor came into the room and after a brief exam said "Madam, he will die before the day is out". And so he did. Jane was said to have been "swindled" out of her share of the business and left for America with the four children. Money came to her periodically from England, so the story goes and was termed "guilt money" according to my father. Many of the family members lived in Glenn Rock New Jersey. That is where my father grew up. Many a Christmas we spent in my grandmother's house there."</i> (Shared by descendant Jon Rudge, grandson of Robert Knapp Rudge.) 
<p>
LETTER FROM WHICH ABOVE STORY IS TAKEN: <i>"Dear Abigail, Aunt Lou has asked me to write in answer to your letter concerning Grandfather and Great Grandfather Rudge. As you perhaps know She is now in her eightieth year; her eyesight is not too strong and her hands are somewhat crippled by rheumatism, all of which makes it very difficult for her to write. This afternoon I spent some time with her talking over that part of our family history which she is able to recall and I trust you will find the following letter scattered memories of some interest. (I might say that Aunt Lou is apt to become slightly confused when sudden demands are made upon her memory and it is necessary to be careful lest she becomes over-excited). Great-grandfather Thomas Rudge was engaged in the drapers; Business and, as Aunt Lou remembers it, traveled about the country at frequent intervals. The family was apparently quite well-to-do, since Great grandmother Rudge brought to America several packing cases of beautiful and valuable possessions (The story of these comes later.) Great grandfather was stricken with apoplexy while in the railroad station of the city in which the family lived (it was in the north of England and may have been Smethwick or Walrall since Great Uncle Fred wished notices of his own death to be published in papers of those cities.) He was picked up by one of the porters of the station and taken to his home where he was placed in a large four-posted bed. The doctor who was called in attendance stood at the foot of this bed and after gazing intently at his patient told our Great Grandmother "He will die, madame," He then moved to a position at the side of the bed and repeated the process of staring intently at Great Grandfather after which he again said, "He will die, Madame"; The doctor was right for he died without regaining consciousness. His age at the time was thirty eight. Aunt Lou was then only two years old, her brother Fred was sixteen or seventeen, and Grandfather was then eight or ten. (I have no way of checking exact dates.) Aunt Lou Remembers that her father, shortly before his death, gave her a Party on the occasion of her second birthday to which there were invited twenty little girls of her own age. Great grandfather was an ardent churchman and was much admired for the stately and dignified manner in which he strode up the aisle into church. - There seems to be some confusion as to what church he attended. Aunt Lou believes it was the Church of England while her brother Fred, who died several years ago, maintained that it was the United Presbyterian. Perhaps Edwin has information which could definitely settle this point. From the above meager facts I picture Great Grandfather Rudge as a man of wide, perhaps speculative business interests, an affectionate husband and father, tall and dignified in appearance. Perhaps this is very wide of the mark. I should like sometime to see his portrait and compare it with the mental image I have formed of him. After Great Grandfather's death there was very little money left to support the family. His executor (his brother Samuel I believe) claimed that all his money, including insurance, had been used to settle his debts. There seems to have been some question of the executor's honesty for Great Grandmother used to receive occasional small sums of money from England which she called "conscious money". Perhaps Edwin has told you all of this. I hope I have not exposed the skeleton in the family cupboard. I have often wondered why the family migrated to America, for They were certainly not of the same social class as the ordinary emigrants of the Civil War period. The clue to the riddle lies, I think, in the character of our great uncle Fred. He was the oldest child of the family and had been apprenticed to a firm of printers in England. Perhaps he was galled by this peculiarly medieval form of bondage; undoubtedly he was attracted by the stories of adventure, opportunity and wealth to be gained in America. Even in his old age when I knew him he was incurably romantic; a fine old-fashioned English gentleman with rosy cheeks and white hair and mustache. He was an amateur poet of some ability and I recall in particular an elegy which he wrote at the time of his wife's death. At any rate I am quite certain that he was the prime mover in the decision to go to America and Aunt Lou concurs in this. They sailed from Liverpool to the "City of Cork" bound for New York. Aunt Lou tells me there had been ten children in the family of whom only four were living at this time - Fred, William, Edwin, Clara and Louise. This is the first time I had heard of Clara and I imagine Aunt Lou's memory may be at fault in this particular. Aunt Lou was three or four years old at the time of the voyage. They traveled in a stateroom, she says, and she remembers being held up to see the sharks that followed the ship. This, and the fact that the crossing took a very long time, are the only things she can remember from these events. Arrived in New York, the family took lodgings in a boarding house on Cedar Street. Here occurred the loss of the contents of the packing-cases. One of the servants in the house broke open the cases and stole the entire contents. The identity of the thief was established by the fact that her hair-net had fallen into one of the cases and was found there when Great-grandmother opened the cases. (What ho! Watson) The stolen goods were never recovered. Uncle Fred, for some reason, did not go out west to fight the Indians, but found a job in his old printing trade (our whole family history hinges upon his early apprenticeship to a printer) and was instrumental in starting his younger brother, our grandfather, in this work. The effort of remembering and telling me all the foregoing had left Aunt Lou tired and I did not wish to press her further for details of Granfather's [sic] life at this time. Some day in the near future I shall try to elicit from her further stories of the early life of the Rudge family in America, with particular reference to her brother, William Edwin and the beginnings of the printing business, his private life and his personal character. I may also be able to add a few details myself from the stories told to me by my father before his death. In the meantime, I am enclosing two letters written to Aunt Lou by Edwin's father, my Uncle Will, from England and France. As Edwin accompanied his father on this trip I am sure that he will find them of interest. Aunt Lou will be glad to hear from you. Perhaps if you wish any other information it might be better for you to write to me and allow me to talk to her without exciting her by the thought that she must answer your letter herself. I should like to make your acquaintance and also see Edwin again. We have met only once in the last ten years. In any cases, write and let me know whether this letter contains some few of the things you wished to know. Sincerely yours, Robert Rudge"</i>(Letter to Abigail nee Hazen Rudge from Robert Knapp Rudge Jr. Dated 10 May 1929)

OBITUARY:<i>"SUICIDE AT WEST BROMWICH.-Yesterday the body of a man was found hanging in an outhouse at the rear of the New Inn, New Street, West Bromwich. A rope was tied around the man's neck, and the other end was attached to the stave of a ladder which was standing in the place, and apparently deceased after fixing the noose round his neck, had leaped off the ladder. Later in the day the body was identified as that of Samuel Holloway Rudge (50), who during the last few weeks has been employed as an agent for the Manchester Industrial Insurance Company, and had been lodging at 81, Bratt Street, West Bromwich.

MOUNT VERNON, N.Y., June 12.- William Edwin Rudge Jr., printer and publisher, who had long been known to connoisseurs all over the world for the high artistic quality of the books issuing from his press here, died late tonight in the Mount Vernon Hospital at the age of 54. He is survived by a widow, who was Miss Lillian M. Gould of Mount Vernon at their marriage in 1906, and two sons, William Edwin 3d and Frederick Gould Rudge. The funeral service will be held at 2 o'clock Monday afternoon in the First Presbyterian Church. Any account of American printing written during the last twenty years has placed the name of Mr. Rudge in a small group of not more than two or three artist-publishers who devoted themselves largely to limited editions wrought with the greatest care for appreciative purchasers. Usually Mr. Rudge's productions also benefited from the designs of Bruce Rogers, as in the case of the "Private Papers of James Boswell From Malahide Castle," an edition of 570 copies that made its first appearance in 1928. Mr. Rudge was born in Brooklyn on Nov. 23, 1876, the son of William Edwin and Lavina Knapp Rudge. After a few years in the public schools he began to work at age 12 in the printing and publishing business in New York City, and remained within hail of New York and in the same calling ever since. Eventually he formed his own corporation bearing his name, with headquarters at 9 Bradford Road, Mount Vernon. Since 1918, Mr. Rudge received two gold medals, two silver medals and two bronze medals in annual printing exhibitions held in New York. In 1925 he won first place at Philadelphia, the next year, also at Philadelphia, honorable mention. President Hoover, as Secretary of Commerce in 1925, chose him to represent the printing industry at the International Exposition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Art in Paris. Mr. Rudge had been a member of the Advisory Board at New York University for the course given by the American Institute of Graphic Arts. He was a member of that institute, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Art-in-Trade club, Grolier and Transportation Clubs.
