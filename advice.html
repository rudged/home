Thefollowing short document shares some advice about making the most of the timeyou spend here at Western Michigan University before you go on the job market.A longer document upon which this is based (<a href="suggestions.html">Suggestions for the Job Market inScience Education</a>) gives specific advice about navigating the job market.</p><p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ScienceEducation is a very heterogeneous discipline, composed of professionals who runthe gamut from teachers and administrators to policy makers and academics. Ifyou choose to pursue science education in an academic setting, there are two discernabledirections your career might lead. Some people choose to pursue positions inscience departments, others choose to pursue positions in colleges ofeducation. It is important that you start thinking early in your graduate schoolcareer which path you will take, because there are many things you can do as agraduate student that can enhance your success on the job market, some of whichare more important for those who pursue a career in a traditional sciencedepartment, others of which are more important for those who want to wind up ina college of education. Perpendicular to this distinction, some positions aremore research oriented, some more teaching oriented.</p><p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><u>Science education position in a science department<o:p></o:p></u></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Ingeneral</i><span style='font-style:normal'>, if you are preparing for a scienceeducation position in a science department, the search committee will beparticularly interested in your background in that science. They will expect anMA/MS in the science or evidence you have successfully taken a significant numberof graduate courses in that science. They often have expectations for scienceeducators based upon conventions in their science, e.g. they will beparticularly interested in your grant writing experience and numbers ofpublications. They will also want to see a clear connection between the dissertationproblem you have chosen for research in science education and learning/pedagogyissues in their particular discipline. In most science departments it isincreasingly uncommon for individuals to step into faculty positions right outof graduate school and almost unheard of to hire someone A.B.D. A post docexperience, particularly one that involves work on a grant that leads topublications, is particularly helpful for individuals pursuing this path.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ifyou choose this path, candidly review your credentials in your chosen sciencediscipline with your advisor. Consider taking graduate level courses in thatscience and perhaps even a masters degree.</p><p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><u>Science education position in a college of education<o:p></o:p></u></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Ingeneral</i><span style='font-style:normal'>, if you are preparing for a scienceeducation position in a college of education, the search committee will beparticularly interested in your K-12 teaching experience. Most positions willrequire you to be certified or eligible for certification to teach in the stateyou are being hired. Search committees will, of course, be impressed by a particularlystrong science background, but it is fair to say their interest will be thebreadth of your science coursework over several science disciplines rather thanone in particular. They will also be particularly interested in your graduatelevel preparation in methods and pedagogy courses offered through the Collegeof Education.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ifyou choose this path, candidly review your K-12 teaching experience with youradvisor. To enhance your K-12 experience, look for opportunities to work inK-12 settings, in-service opportunities for teachers, and state or nationallevel development work. Consider also taking graduate level classes ineducation to supplement your credentials.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Toshore up your credentials as a researcher, in general, you should make a pointof attending and presenting talks at professional conferences while you are ingraduate school. While attending any science education related conference ishelpful, it is fair to say that some conferences are dominated more byindividuals who hold positions in colleges of education than others (e.g.AETS). Conversely, you may find that many science conferences have sectionsdevoted to teaching and learning issues (e.g. AAAS, American Chemical Society).Attending a conference is a great way to learn about current research andperhaps identify a potential dissertation topic. It is also an opportunity tostart networking.</p><p class=MsoNormal>Likewise, publishing in the general area of scienceeducation in any forum as a graduate student is a very prestigious feather inyour cap. But again, some journals are better known for work done byresearchers in colleges of education, others for work done by science educatorsin particular departments. Getting involved in grant work is also helpful inestablishing your research credentials.</p><p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Toshore up your credentials as a teacher, in general, you should make a point of teachingduring your graduate career. When hiring, most academic departments wantevidence that you can teach more than one course, because in all likelihoodthey will need someone who is flexible and capable of teaching a variety ofcourses. Take advantage of opportunities to teach several different types ofcourses when you can, and when you can't, consider taking graduate levelcourses in topics individuals who pursue your career path will be expected toteach. Those who go on to careers in science departments should concentrate onshoring up their teaching repertoire with regard to courses in a particularscience, those who plan to go on to a position in a college of education shouldteach/take advanced courses in pedagogy and methods.</p><p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     </span>Finally, take advantage of the numerous workshops WMU has to offer     graduate students throughout the year, devoted to teaching and learning issues,     surviving graduate school and completing the dissertation.</p>  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>  <p class=MsoNormal>Please share comments and/or suggestions you have about the     advice on this page <a href="acomments.html">here</a>.</p><p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><i>Last modified 15 Nov2005<o:p></o:p></i></p></div><!-- Start of StatCounter Code --><script type="text/javascript">var sc_project=1056643; var sc_invisible=0; var sc_partition=6; var sc_security="627daa6c"; </script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.statcounter.com/counter/counter_xhtml.js"></script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><a class="statcounter" href="http://www.statcounter.com/"><img class="statcounter" src="http://c7.statcounter.com/1056643/0/627daa6c/0/" alt="web site analytic" /></a></div></noscript><!-- End of StatCounter Code --></body></html>
