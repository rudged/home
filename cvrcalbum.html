<p>
This is a tintype of two young girls. I think these are Betty Louise Rudge and her younger sister Caroline Virginia nee Rudge Coble. Betty died on 27 Jun 1879, so this photo must have been taken earlier.

This is a tintype of a girl. The name written on the back states "Carrie Rudge Coble". Notice the last word appears to have been added later, i.e. after she married.

<p>
Here is a group photograph that appears to be a staged photo from a play they might have been in. William John Rudge and his sister, Caroline Virginia nee Rudge Coble appear on the right side.

<center><a name="nine">9. CAROLINE VIRGINIA NEE RUDGE COBLE</center>
<p>
This is a photograph of Caroline Virginia nee Rudge Coble. On the back it reads "Jennil [?] to her friend [?] C.V.R". I've independently discovered an 1888 Richmond city directory entry for her father, John William Rudge, so it is possible that this was taken when the family lived there. If so, she would have been 14 years old. But family had relatives on the Pae side that lived in Richmond, so this could also have been taken on a visit.

<center><a name="ten">10. FIRST BELK STORE</center>
<p>
This is a photograph of the front of the first Belk store (New York Racket) in Monroe, NC, where Caroline Virginia Rudge and her brother William John Rudge were employed. While some sources claim the photo was taken in 1897, an old newspaper (Monroe Enquirer 1 Sep 1938) quotes Henry Belk as implying it was taken ca. 1890. From left to right: 1. Carrie Rudge, 2. Henry Brown, 3. Dr. Redfearn, 4. Ed Austin, 6. Will Rudge, 7. Henry Walkup, 8. Unidentified man in doorway, 9. Billy Benton. (Will Rudge would have been about 14 in 1890, and this seems correct.)

<p>
Here’s a photograph of Louise Rudge Coble and her mother, Caroline Virginia nee Rudge Coble. Louise appears to be about 1 or 2 years old, and so this photo was taken ca. 1915.

<p>
On the back of this photo is written "These were taken about six years ago. Don't know if you all saw them, but thought they were good of Moma. I believe the last ones she posed for. The others in the picture aren't so good so don't look at us. Moma Coble in center." The woman on the left appears to be Hope Helene nee Reinhard Coble. The man is John Bunyan Coble Jr. The boy in Hope's arms is their son David Coble. The boy standing is their other son, Ronald. Judging from the children's ages, this was probably taken ca. 1950.
