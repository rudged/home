The first few years here were spent in farming near Lowell,MI. When I first came to this country I was not sure that I would remain here,but I liked America and took out my citizenship papers on June 6, 1896 havingdecided to make this my future home. I did not like farming too well and in1899 obtained employment at a Cutter and Buggy factory at Lowell. One of theearly telephones was installed in this factory, which was a source of curiosity,never having used one, so I was rather amazed to be called to answer it oneday. The call was from my good friend Anthony Kallinger, who was in charge of asmall Hydro Plant on the Flat River just north of Lowell, who wanted me to meethim at the plant as soon as convenient. So, on a day in December, 1899 I keptmy appointment and Anthony at the plant to hear that he was in need of anoperator and had me in mind.</p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Iwas very skeptical about taking the job, as I knew nothing about electricityand while I had a good education in French and German, I still could not readand write English. Mr. Kallinger assured me that he was looking for someone whoknew nothing about the plant, so he could in his own way teach the fundamentalsof electricity. In that case, I told him he couldn&#8217;t find a biggergreenhorn to teach and at the age of 29 years, I accepted the job.</p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thisfirst job in my hydro-electric career paid me $30.00 per month for a 12-hourday, seven days a week work schedule. The little power house had one Stanleytwo-phase generator bolted to three vertical water wheels and two exciters. Thegenerator voltage was 1,000 volts, which was stepped up, through a series of transformers,to 10,000 volts and transmitted over a two phase line to Grand Rapids. Thisline was one of the first commercial transmission lines in the United States.</p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Alongwith my entry into hydro electricity was another new experience which exceededin length of years my operating career. I was elected that same year asdirector of a rural school board in Vergennes Twp. Between my two jobs, Iearnestly set about to learn to read and write English, as well as learn theoperation of the hydro plant. An interesting experience at that time was myfirst school report, which was sent to the Kent Co. Commissioner of Schools atGrand Rapids and was returned to me. I had taken great pains to have itcorrect, being well aware of my English handicap and was very disappointed tohave it returned. I could find no mistakes in it so I just sent it back again.Later I was complimented by the Commissioner on having the most accurate andneatest report. The reason why it was first returned was because the secretarywas so accustomed to having the reports done in fractions, and because of myEuropean education in the metric system, I had used decimals and she thought itmust be wrong. I was probably the first report ever sent in using decimals,which of course, is the accepted form today.</p><p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><spanstyle='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About1902, the Grand Rapids Edison Co. acquired the little Hydro plant and also adam site farther up the Flat River, where they built a dam and power house,which was completed in 1904. I was then transferred to the new plant. This wasa happy time in my life. I was not only to get $50.00 a month in wages, but thework week was only six days, with a little extra time off once in a whilethrough exchanging hours among ourselves.</p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ThisNew Plant, so called to differentiate it from what was known as the Old Plant,was larger and furnished with what was then the most modern equipment. Therewere two generators, each of which was directly connected to horizontalturbines, and controlled by Lombard governors. Mr. Kallinger was in charge ofboth plants and we studied together about all the new equipment, which includedsuch things as governors, relays, various types of transformers and switchboardinstruments.</p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thelatter part of 1904, the Grand Rapids Edison Power Co. was acquired by theGrand Rapids/Muskegon Power Co. and the 2 plants and personnel were put underthe direct supervision of Mr. A. F. Walker, who was Superintendent ofProduction and Transmission for the latter company. The Grand Rapids/MuskegonPower Co. had interests along the Muskegon River and by early 1906 already hadRogers Dam near Big Rapids in operation. At the same time another new dam andpower house were under construction at Croton, MI. Mr. Kallinger and I heardthe rumors about this new dam, which was to be the largest hydro in Michigan,and we often discussed it. To settle his curiosity, Mr. Kallinger made a tripto Croton to see for himself what it was like. He came back with great talesabout the immensity of the project and how very complicated it would be tooperate.</p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Duringthe summer of 1907, while visiting the New Plant, Mr. Walker approached meabout taking an operating job at Croton. I remember, when asking him about pay,hours, etc, that he told me laughingly that there wouldn&#8217;t be any timeoff. At Croton there wouldn&#8217;t be time for an operator to go to his ownfuneral. Feeling sure that Mr. Walker had me in mind to go to Croton, I decidedto make the trip and see for myself what this &#8220;new wonder in electricaloutput&#8221; was like. It was late August, 1907 when I took the train fromLowell to Newaygo. There was a change of trains at Grand Rapids with a waitbetween. During this wait I sauntered up town in Grand Rapids and was on my wayto the station when I accidentally met Mr. Walker. He told me that I was justthe man he wanted to see, and looking at his watch, told me that I just hadtime to catch the train to Newaygo. With that, he urged me on my way to thestation, saying that he would telephone Mr. Kallinger and my wife, and wouldmake arrangements to have someone meet me at Newaygo, and, that I was to go toCroton to stay there until I heard from him.</p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Iremember distinctly that it was a Friday late afternoon when I arrived inCroton. I immediately sensed that I was not welcome here. Evidently thegrapevine had it that I was to be an operator and it caused some jealousy onthe part of certain men who had worked on the construction and were eying theoperating jobs for themselves. Therefore, I was sort of a &#8216;lonewolf&#8217; on the job. On Saturday morning, following my arrival, thetemporary gates on sluiceways below the dam were permanently closed and theCroton Pond began to form. By Sunday morning the water started to run into thewheel pits and the generators were started, being put on short circuit fordrying out the generator windings.</p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Duringmy first week in Croton, all equipment was still in charge of the Constructiondept., which gave me a good opportunity to devote all my time to studying theplant and it&#8217;s operation. I soon learned that it varied very little from theequipment in the New Plant on the Flat River, except that everything was muchlarger. The principle was the same.</p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thefollowing Saturday was to be the big day when Mr. J.B. Foote, ElectricalEngineer and General Manager, and other officials were to be present when theproject was to be in running order and officially turned over from constructionto the operating dept. During the week proceeding the final deadline, I noticedthat Mr. Victor Derby, the erecting engineer, was having trouble putting the governorsin operation. Every time he put them on line, they would go from shut to wideopen and reverse, instead of maintaining proper speed, and would have to betaken off the line again. This was a matter of great concern to Mr. Derby asthe generators were supposed to be in operating condition by Saturday. Havinghad previous experience with the same type of governor at Lowell, I soon foundwhat the trouble wa. There were 2 left hand governors and 2 right handgovernors, and by mistake, they were placed just opposite to their correctpositions, which made them absolutely unworkable. As the plant had not yet beenturned over to operation, and as I was not too welcome on the job, I was notconsulted about the matter. Apparently Mr. Derby sensed that I might know whatwas wrong, and in desperation early Saturday morning, he turned to me for help.I told Mr. Derby that all he had to do was change the governor heads to theirproper positions. Immediately the two of us began working and together wechanged the heads, so that everything was in working order by the time theInspection Party arrived at the plant. Mr. Derby appreciated my help very muchand from that time on we were good friends. In fact, it was a turning point inmy Croton career, as everyone became more friendly and my &#8220;lonewolf&#8221; days were over.</p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thenext two weeks I was the sold operator at the plant, having my meals brought tome, while the construction department furnished me with a night watchman, whichenabled me a few winks of sleep. Finally Mr. Walker telephoned me that I was tobe in charge of the plant at a salary of $65.00 a month, operating a reliefshift of two twelve hour shifts each week, and that I should hire 2 operators.I hired Charles Harger and John Seastrom. Mr. Harger was with us for only ashort time, having taken advantage of a more lucrative position in Wisconsin,and his place was taken by Clyde Thayer. Mr. Seastrom later was made assistantand both he and Clyde Thayer remained with the Company for many years untiltheir retirement.</p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evenat that time, I was not sure that I would remain in Croton. The power plant wasa great challenge to me and I knew I would like my job. It was the communitywhich discouraged me. There wasn&#8217;t what I considered to be a decent houseavailable for my family and no thought of opening the school. Only one schoolofficer remained, the other two having moved away with the completion of thedam. It was only after Mr. George L. Erwin made arrangements to have acomfortable house built for me, and one school officer promised to open theschool, which he did with the help of another native, who agreed to take theoffice of school treasurer, that I finally decided to move my family fromLowell and remain at Croton. Needless to say, I became a member of the schoolboard the following year, at which time I was elected an officer at Croton. Iam proud to state that I served continuously as a school board member until Iretired recently making a total of fifty years. I doubt if any otherforeign-born member has such a record.</p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The70,000 original volt line from the Rogers Dam came through Croton and we werecut in on this line for the first few months. Upon completion of the steeltower line from Croton to Grand Rapids in 1908, the transformer taps werechanged from 70,000 volts to 110,000 volts, thus energizing the new line. Itwas during this time that Croton Dam reached its height in popularity, due tothe new line being equipped with suspension type insulators, the first of theirkind in the world, and carrying the highest voltage then known in existence.This enterprise attracted engineers from near and far including Canada,European countries, Japan, India and South America. It was not the size ofCroton Dam that interested them, but rather the fact that electricity could bemanufactured at this remote place and transmitted for use in Grand Rapids andMuskegon. It was the high voltage transmission which was of such greatinterest. In the main, these visiting engineers were astonished at thesimplicity of the installation and operation. After all, it was only a matterof higher voltage which required more insulation.</p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Itis my personal opinion that Mr. J.B. Foote has never received sufficientrecognition for his contribution to the pioneering development of high voltageapparatus and transmission lines. Later, I was privileged to have supervisionof other dams, among them Junction (now Tippy Dam), from which there was a140,000 volt transmission line to Grand Rapids, which also set a record asbeing the highest in the world at that time. </p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In1944, at age 73 years and after 44 years of continuous service to ConsumersPower Co. and its predecessors, I retired from active service.</p></div></body></html>
