He was born on 8 Aug 1790 in Madbury, Strafford Co. NH and died on 16 Mar 1833 in Madbury, Strafford Co. NH. He never married.

He was born on 19 May 1806 in NH and died on 26 Jan 1876 in Dover, Strafford Co. NH. He married <strong> Lucinda HARRIS</strong> on 30 Apr 1841. She was born ca. 1814 in ME and died on 18 Mar 1895 in Dover, Strafford Co. NH. The had the following children:

She was born ca. 1796-1797 in Madbury, Strafford Co. NH and died on 6 Aug 1876 in Deerfield, Rockingham Co. NH.
<p>
<a name="nineteen"><strong>19. Hezekiah<sup>5</sup> COOK</strong> III. (<a href="#fourteen">Hezekiah<sup>4</sup>, <a href="#six">Hezekiah<sup>3</sup>, <a href="#two">John</a><sup>2</sup>, <a href="#one">John</a><sup>1</sup>). He was born ca. 1798 in NH. He died between 1860-1870. The records I have found for him refer to him as a "farmer" and a "yeoman." The first definitive record that mentions him is a record of his marriage to <strong>Eliza FRENCH</strong> on 28 May 1821 in Northwood, Rockingham Co. NH. According to the record, he was from Epping, Rockingham Co. NH, while she was from Nottingham, Rockingham Co. N.H. From the census records, Eliza FRENCH was also born ca. 1798 and died on 20 Aug 1885 according to her obituary. Hezekiah COOK and his wife Eliza FRENCH are presumably buried in one of eleven graves marked by field stones without inscriptions in the Earle-Whitehouse cemetery, Waterboro, York Co. ME.
<p>
Hezekiah appears to be a son of the Hezekiah COOK II mentioned above who resided in Madbury, Stratford Co. NH during the 1800-1820 censuses. Eliza appears to be the daughter of Samuel FRENCH, who is the only head of household with the surname FRENCH in the 1820 census for Nottingham, Rockford Co. NH who had a woman living in his household of the appropriate age. 
<p>
Hezekiah COOK is presumably one and the same Hezekiah COOK listed in the 1830 census for Epping, Rockingham Co. NH. He and his wife migrated to Waterborough, York Co. ME and are included in the 1840 census where he is listed as engaged in agriculture, with a total of seven persons in his house.

<p>
Hezekiah and his family are included in the 1850 census for neighboring Hollis, York Co. ME; in the 1860 census he (62 yrs. old) his wife (62 yrs. old) and youngest son Hosea (24 years old) are included once more in the census for Waterborough, York Co. ME. By their location in the census (assuming it was done in order) they were living in the "Gerry neighborhood" of North Waterboro, near Edgecomb's bridge and the Limington Line near Hollis. In the 1870 census for Waterborough, York Co., his widow Eliza (age 74) appears in an entry with her son Hosea.

He was born ca. 1823-25 in either NH or ME and died 5 Nov 1908 in Gloucester, Essex Co. MA. He was a stonemason. 
<p>Joseph Brown married <strong>Salome ANDREWS</strong> on 24 Apr 1856 in Moscow, Somerset, ME (IGI Batch 5015199 Source 1553647). (The date of this marriage record suggests his son Bella was born either out of wedlock or by a previous wife.) All but the last of the census records mentioned below refer to Salome as being born in ME. She was born ca. 1822 and appears to have preceded her husband in death.
<p>
CENSUS RECORDS: According to the 1850 census for Hollis, York, Co. ME Joseph B. was born ca. 1823 in NH. A second 1850 census record that appears to refer to him includes him in the 1850 census for Gloucester, Essex Co. MA, where he is indicated as being born in 1825 and a stonecutter born in ME and living in a boarding house. The 1860 census for Gloucester, Essex Co. MA includes a "Joseph B. Cook" age 34, and includes entries for Salome (age 28), Bella (age 6) and "Joseph F." (age 2). (The latter appears to be a reference to his son Frank.) Both of the children are listed as having been born in ME. In the 1870 census for Gloucester, Essex Co. MA, Joseph B. (age 41, stonecutter)is listed with his wife Salome (age 38), son Bela (age 16) and son Francis J. (age 12). In the 1880 census for Gloucester, Essex Co. MA, Joseph B. Cook (age 52, "foreman in Quarry") is accompanied by his wife Salome (age 48), and children Bela (age 26), Frank J. (age 21) and daughter Lauraetta (age 8). In all of these entries Joseph B. is listed as being born in NH. In the 1900 census for Gloucester, Essex Co. MA Joseph B. (age 72) and his wife Salome (age 68) are listed together at 744 Washington St. She is indicated as having had four children, of whom 2 survived. Next to them appears to be an entry for their son, "Francis J. Cook" (age 40) and his family.
<p>
In records of Waterborough Town Meetings a Joseph COOK was chosen and sworn as a surveyor of highways on 24 Apr 1847. A record of assessment of taxes for Town of Waterborough in 1893 includes reference to a "Joseph Cook of Lunesville [?], Mass.: lot of land on Portland Road bounded by land of J. W. Haley, Ivory Earll heirs, H. L. Strout and A. Fluent. Acres: 10." He is also mentioned in a Quit-claim deed from Joseph A. Hobbs to Belinda Ellen Fluent Cook as the original owner of the Cook Homestead, and living in  Lanesville, Essex Co., MA. It is interesting to note that the 1860 census entry for Joseph B. Cook mentioned above specifically states that the Gloucester entries on the page refer to individuals having the Lanesville post office box.
<p>
Joseph B. Cook appears in the 1902, 1903, 1905, 1907, and 1909 city directories for Gloucester, Essex Co. MA. In each he is listed as a foreman residing at 744 Washington (Bay View). In the 1911 city directory for Gloucester, Essex Co. MA, an entry states "Cook, Joseph B. died Nov 5 1908" (p. 104). There is no reference to his widow.

FUNERAL NOTICES: <cite>"LANESVILLE... Mortuary. It has been decided that the funeral of the late Joseph Brown Cook will be held in the Bay View Methodist Episcopal church at 2 o'clock tomorrow afternoon, because it will be more convenient and commodious than the family residence that was mentioned first. Cape Ann Lodge, Knights of Pythias, will meet in their hall at 1 o'clock and will attend the funeral in a body. Interment will be made at Oak Grove Cemetery."</cite> (Gloucester Daily Times and Cape Ann Advertiser 7 Nov 1908) <cite>"LANESVILLE... Funeral Services. Funeral services over the remains of the late Joseph Brown Cook were held in the Methodist Episcopal church in Bay View yesterday afternoon. Rev. M. Emory Wright officiated in a very acceptable manner by reading scriptural selections, speaking sympathetic words and offering prayer. The singers connected with the church rendered several selections, with Mrs. Helen Farwell as organist. About 25 members of Cape Ann Lodge, Knights of Pythias, attended in a body, besides others scattered throughout the audience. Prelate William Coad gave the Pythian ritual, after which friends passed around to take a last look at the remains. The pall bearers were brothers of the lodge, Charles F. Newman, John C. Hodgdon, Albert Lane and Charles W. Poole. Mr. Frank Cook of Wood's Holl and other relatives from out of town were present. Postmaster Charles H. Andrews of Pigeon Cove, a former superintendent of the Lanesville Granite Company where the deceased worked for many years, was present also, out of respect, as well as Mr. John W. Butman of Rockport, son of the former superintendent. At the close of the funeral services at the church the Pythian fraternity escorted the cortege as far as the Bay View engine house on the way to Oak Grove cemetery where interment was made."</cite> (Gloucester Daily Times and Cape Ann Advertiser 9 Nov 1908).

According to a note by his nephew, Charles Herbert COOK, Joseph B.COOK and Salome nee ANDREWS had three children:

He was born ca. 1831 in ME. He died 15 Mar 1877 in Waterborough, York Co., ME and was initially buried in Waterborough, York Co. ME. In 1925 both his and his wife's remains were transferred to the Eastern Cemetary, Gorham, Cumberland Co. ME. He was a farmer and later a teamster. Here's a <A HREF="c2-19.html">photograph</a> of him.
<p>
Charles COOK (age 20) is listed as living with his father in the 1850 census for Hollis, York Co. ME, age 20. A second entry that appears to refer to him is in the 1850 census for Waterboro, where a Charles COOK is listed as living with Ivory Earle (37), a farmer, and his wife Mary (31). The fact that Charles W. COOK is listed as a surveyor of highways for the general neighborhood of the Earle home at Waterboro Town Meetings for 1852, 1855, and 1857 (not to mention his future wife lived nearby), strongly suggests this entry also refers to him.
<p>
There is a record of his intention to marry<strong> Belinda Ellen FLUENT</strong>, daughter of Ezra FLUENT III & Rhoda A. CHADBOURNE, on 17 Feb 1855 in Waterborough, York Co. ME. She was born on 21 Jan 1835 in Waterborough, York Co. ME. She died of cancer of the uterus on 14 Feb 1896 in Waterboro, York Co. ME. Here's a <A HREF="c2-17.html">photograph</a> of her.
<p>
A note written by him to his wife reads as follows- <cite>"I want you to come to Boston when you come write to me the day you shall Satert [Start?] from Ames I will meet you at the Depot. I will write you again next week. I shall Dyreet [?] to North Hempton N.H.E. Linnie E. Cook. I shall send you some money. Good By Dearest wife hoping to see you soon. C. W. Cook"</cite>

A York County Deed (vol. 234 p. 185) details the sale of land by Edward Lafayette of Waterboro to Charles W. Cook "of said Waterboro, gentleman," on 11 Oct 1853. A second deed record (v. 237, pp. 239-240) indicates Charles W. Cook, of Waterborough, York Co. sold this parcel of land to Porter Gilman of Hollis on 21 Sep 1854. A third deed record (v. 250 p. 386) indicates Charles W. Cook "of Waterboro, gentleman" purchased land from Ivory Earle on 7 Jun 1855. A fourth deed record (vol. 253 p. 378) indicates Charles W. Cook, "yeoman of Waterboro" sold land to Charles B. Mills on 2 May 1857. Yet another deed record (v. 256 pp. 131-132) indicates Porter Gilman sold land to Charles W. Cook of Waterborough on 3 Dec 1857.
<p>
An 1856 map of Waterboro, York Co. ME has a house designated as "Chas. Cook" in North Waterboro, south east and across the old Portland road from a house marked "T. Earl." This corresponds with the order of families in the 1860 census for Waterborough, York Co. ME. We have located the foundations of both houses. At the COOK homestead we were able to find the remains of what appears to be a half cellar, an old well, and a retaining wall. The 1860 census suggests his father Hezekiah was living in the same area and may have built this house.
<p>
A "Charles Cook" age 28 is listed as a farm hand in the home of Reuben Hill in Waterboro, according to the York Co. 1860 Census. This is curious both because he is listed as a bachelor and is indicated as a farm hand rather than the owner of his own homestead (as depicted on the 1856 map for Waterborough. The above reference to Boston suggests he and his family may have migrated from Waterborough for a time.
<p>
Charles W. Cook and his family appear in the 1870 census for Parsonsfield, York Co. ME. He is listed as 40 years old, a teamster, born in New Hampshire. His wife Belinda is listed as 36 years old, keeping house and born in Maine. Their son Charles Cook is identified as 10 years old, at school and born in Maine.
<p>
Another land deed record from York County (v. 323 p. 497) indicates Charles W. Cook of Parsonsfield, York Co. ME sold land in Waterborough to [his brothers] Joseph B. COOK of Lanesville, Essex Co. MA and Henry H. COOK and his wife Sarah of Boston, Suffolk Co. MA on 1 Feb 1871.
<p>
Belinda Cook (age 44) is present in the 1880 census for Waterboro, York Co. ME. She is identified as "keeping house" and living with son Charley H. Cook.

Text of a letter from Geneva McDaniel Stiehl (Fanny McDaniel's daughter) to Ralph M. Cook upon news that his father had died (26 Jun 1945) <cite>"I have heard from you indirectly-from Gorham- and I know you all are now through another hard experience. Your father was certainly a very good father to you. I think he understood so many of your problems and tried to help you. He always said he and you were very close. How nice now to have that to think about. He was certainly a very kind uncle. I have only the most pleasant memories of him and I think of him as he was in his early working days in Boston he was a brave soldier going out each day, working hard for his little family. Now his last days were peaceful and you have been most faithful to him. I [chanced ?] to hear that you are over-working. Must you? I'm afraid you may find it does not pay. I'd love to see you, Laura and Beverly Ann- We should manage a meeting somehow. Much love to you all.

<p>
HOW THEY MET: <cite>Ruby Mae Breitkreutz Graffunder writes "As for Uncle Ralph, he worked as a salesman for Studebaker Auto Co. in New York City. Why Aunt Laura went to NYC is a mystery to me but that's where she met Uncle Ralph. When Studebaker went out of business, Uncle Ralph ended up in St. Paul working for Montgomery Ward Co. When MW & Co. built a place in Menands, Uncle Ralph was transferred there. I don't really know much more about him. He was a wonderful person with a nice sense of humor and was forever correcting my grammar."</cite> His daughter, Beverly Anne COOK recalls that Ralph and Laura roomed in the same apartment building, with the male and female tenants segregated.
<p>
According to Ruby Mae Breitkreutz Graffunder, Ralph came to work for Montgomery Wards in St. Paul, MN after Studebaker in NY City went out of business in 1924; she also recalls that he left St. Paul for Menands, NY when Montgomery Wards opened its new plant there and offered him a pay raise if he would consent to a transfer. (letters to Dave Rudge 11/28/95; 11/12/95).  
<p>
On 22 Oct 1949 Ralph completed 25 years of service with Montgomery Ward & Company as a Service Merchandiser of Divisions 61 and 64 (Buyer of auto accessories).  He was presented with a gold  (Buren) watch (we still have) inscribed as follows- <cite>"PRESENTED TO RALPH M.
