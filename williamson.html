This is a genealogy of a Williamson family that lived in Henrico County, VA. My research has focused on the descendants of <a href="#one">1. John B. Williamson</a> (1776-1815), who lived in Hanover Co. and Henrico Co. VA. 
<p>
A second John Williamson (d. Jul 1806) lived in Henrico Co. VA about at the time of my ancestor. I have no idea whether they were related. This second John Williamson married Sarah Price and, according to his will, had at least six children, Thomas Williamson, John Price Williamson, Elizabeth Williamson, Mary Lancaster Williamson, Rebecca nee Williamson Bowles and Sarah B. nee Williamson Talley. Those who are interested in following the descendants of Sarah B. nee Williamson Talley should contact George Hughes Jr. (ghu10728@comcast.net).

<a name="one"><strong>1. John B.<sup>1</sup> Williamson</strong>. He was born the eldest son of George Williamson ca. 1776 presumably in VA and died on 22 Apr 1815 in Richmond, Henrico Co., VA (according to what appears to be an obituary for him (extract below)). The note above identifies him as of Scotish descent. In a letter giving his consent for his daughter to marry, he indicates he was writing while living in Hanover Co. VA. 
<p>
John B. married <strong>Mary Oglevy BREEDLOVE</strong> ca. 1790, presumably in  VA. Information about her ancestry is located <a href="breedlove.html">here</a>.
